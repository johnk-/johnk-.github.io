    <description>So, this is somewhat trivial.  But what if you wanted a function that instead of RETURN ending the function, it just added to the results and moved on?  [We might call this a COLLECTOR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35qsykW3f58).

Let&#39;s imagine that we like KEEP better than renaming to RETURN

    collector: func [spec block] [return func spec compose [collect (block)]]
    ; ^-- Ren-C semantics for COMPOSE, BLOCK! only splices if ((...))

    c: collector [x] [
        keep x + 1
        keep x + 2
        keep x + 3
    ]

    &gt;&gt; c 10
    == [11 12 13]

    &gt;&gt; c 20
    == [21 22 23]

    &gt;&gt; c 30

<p>Yes, I am actually in the midst of trying to suss out what it takes to implement coroutines.  I just documented this because I had been offering it as a contrast, e.g. <em>what coroutines aren't</em>.</p>
<p>Coroutines require suspending evaluative state and resuming it...which is a very deep idea fraught with technical peril.  But, I am making slow and steady progress on it.  It's not something that happens overnight.</p>

            <p>For the right perspective here, this is something different than using of so called coroutines where the co-routine gets halted or paused to transfer control to another coroutine that can either finish or pass control over again.</p>
<p>How I solve this thing is just collecting all stuff in a block and return that.</p>
<p>I somehow can imagine some use of this in gaming where this would run and go calculate (perhaps in a loop) until some trigger (timer) goes off and then a break follows that results in the function to return all collected values.</p>
