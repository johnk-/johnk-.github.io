<h2><a href="https://github.com/red/red/wiki/%5BLINKS%5D-Design-questions">Red Design Questions Wiki</a></h2>
<p>I'm bookmarking it here, along with some quick review notes.</p>
<h4>Vector &amp; matrix DSL design</h4>
<p>No real comment, other than it's interesting that the order of the page ranks things as "most influential".  While in Ren-C, R3-Alpha's VECTOR! has been removed from the core (you can build a Ren-C without it).  Hence it isn't one of the built-in types identified by a byte in the header.  So it's <a href="../../user-defined-datatype-discussion/1203.html">a primordial test of a custom type</a>, and that is the main lens through which its relevance is considered.</p>
<p>I'm sure if they want plenty of opinions on VECTOR! they can talk to Oldes.</p>
<h4>Parse DSL: simplify  <code>fail</code>  rule to  <code>[end skip]</code> ,  <code>break</code> / <code>reject</code>  to return success/failure  <em>from the loop (while/any/some)</em> ,  <code>break now</code>  as an emergency exit from the loop, bring  <code>also</code>  into parsing</h4>
<p>END SKIP as a way to force a fail is an amusing idea.  But much improvedly, Ren-C just gives meaning to LOGIC! true in PARSE as "keep parsing" and LOGIC! false as "fail here".  (See below for cool ramifications of that.)  So you can fail just by saying FALSE.  It takes away from the ability to match LOGIC! values literally, but you can't match INTEGER! values or BLOCK! values literally without a "QUOTE".  And with the <a href="https://forum.rebol.info/t/quoted-arrives-formerly-known-as-lit-bit/995/2">generic quoting Red argues against</a> you've got more convenience in that area, e.g. <strong>'#[true]</strong> or <strong>'[a b c]</strong> or <strong>'3</strong>.</p>
<p>It is good for naming reasons, too since FAIL has very specific meaning in Ren-C (way to raise errors, <strong>fail "msg"</strong> is nicer than <strong>do make error! "msg"</strong> and provides a dialecting opportunity).</p>
<p>The rest I'd have to look at in more detail to have an opinion on.</p>
<h4>Parse DSL: rules with arguments</h4>
<p>If I read this right...Ren-C has all this and more with GET-GROUP!.  <img src="../../../images/emoji/twitter/boxing_glove.png%3Fv=9" title=":boxing_glove:" class="emoji" alt=":boxing_glove:">  This evaluates much like a plain GROUP! in a PARSE...but instead of the result vaporizing...it dynamically composes itself into the parse stream.  That makes it a full superset of PARSE's unusual IF...since in Ren-C LOGIC! true means "keep parsing" and LOGIC! false means "rule fails".  Thus <strong>:(mode = 'foo)</strong> gets you the continue-or-not you want.  But far more open-ended than that, especially since NULL vaporizes and continues the PARSE as #[true] would.  It's all kinds of keen:</p>
<p><a href="../../double-your-pleasure-double-your-fun/968.html">GET-GROUP!s in PARSE mean execute-and-splice-as-rule</a></p>
<p>So if you want a dynamically generated rule as a function, just say <strong>:(my-rule-maker arg1 arg2)</strong> and it will be spliced in.</p>
<p>I consider that bit solved.  But the part that isn't solved is saving you the trouble of capturing material to pass separately...kind of as if you could extend PARSE with your function acting kind of like a keyword.  Imaginative pseudocode:</p>
<pre><code> &gt;&gt; print-reverse: parse-func [x] [print reverse x]
 &gt;&gt; parse "aaabcdef" [3 "a" print-reverse [to end]]
 fedcb
</code></pre>
<p>e.g. the "argument fulfillment" phase is using parse rules--and not the evaluator--to do it.  But where I lean in this direction is asking about whether there is a model by which PARSE can be extensible in the same way DO of a BLOCK! is extensible... some kind of analogue to regular functions that lets you batch together "native" PARSE extensions (like THRU or INTO) along with user-added ones that speak the protocol (as if someone could add COLLECT after-the-fact).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> This has been <a href="../../introducing-uparse-the-hackable-usermode-parse/1529.html">hit with a bullseye by UPARSE</a>...and the problem of calling normal functions while passing them captured parse material is covered by <a href="../../if-action-combinators-dont-impress-i-dont-know-what-will/1608.html">the ACTION! combinator</a></p>
<pre><code> &gt;&gt; print-reverse: func [x] [print reverse x]
 &gt;&gt; uparse "aaabcdef" [3 "a" print-reverse/ [across to &lt;end&gt;]]
 fedcb
</code></pre>
<p><em>Yes, that actually works in UPARSE!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Core: open problems of the object design</h4>
<p>Tip of the iceberg of the problems with the model.  <img src="../../../images/emoji/twitter/ice_cube.png%3Fv=9" title=":ice_cube:" class="emoji" alt=":ice_cube:">  While Ren-C inherited the same object-model madness, techniques like generic quoting <a href="../../generic-quoting-makes-headway-on-make-object/997.html">are making inroads representationally</a>, and things like <a href="https://github.com/metaeducation/ren-c/pull/727">derived binding</a> are aiding classic problems:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Derived binding is an interesting design that overcomes a serious weakness of historical Rebol combinatorics (where 1000 instances of an object with 50 member functions each had to make deep copies of the bodies of each function so the words in the bodies would point to the instance, so you're making 50,000 deep copies just to create those 1000 objects)."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For a simple example, see <a href="https://github.com/metaeducation/ren-c/blob/3183acf3ee59e8ebc316ca5afeed09d493de8234/tests/datatypes/object.test.reb#L115">"O-Big"</a></p>
<h4>Core: efficient vector arithmetic</h4>
<p>Regarding their "<a href="https://github.com/red/red/issues/2216">Adding a number to a vector changes the vector itself #2216</a>", I have proposed a concept whereby operations like ADD and MULTIPLY follow Rebol's "mutate by default" rules, and PLUS (infix alias +) and TIMES (infix alias *) finesse the idea of not mutating.  These ideas originated in design for <a href="../../planning-ahead-for-bignum-arithmetic/623.html">efficient BigNum arithmetic</a>, which shares many of the same issues.</p>
<p>Devil is in the details there, but it proposes building things on a model that is foundationally mutating.</p>
<h4>VID DSL: automatically bind (literal only?) actor &amp; reaction bodies to the face?</h4>
<p>N/A.</p>
<h4>Core: loop return values</h4>
<p>Ren-C has a systemic <a href="https://forum.rebol.info/t/the-simple-yet-powerful-magic-of-the-loop-result-protocol/609">loop return result protocol</a>.  All loops that BREAK return NULL, and there is no BREAK/RETURN.  If you wish to violate the protocol, you do so with THROW to a CATCH.</p>
<p>This is a helpful protocol for building your own loop constructs out of other loops...without having to reach in and figure out how to hook their BREAK.  Being able to tell from the outside if the loop was interrupted far outweighs the idea of BREAK/RETURN, and "heavy nulls" are an idea well worth it to ensure that pure NULL keeps its unique status for representing break.</p>
<h4>Core: behavior of series access outside the data boundaries</h4>
<p>I talk some about this in <a href="../../where-the-series-ends-simplifying-out-of-bounds-rules/1141.html">"Where the Series Ends"</a> <em>(for you young folks, that's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where_the_Sidewalk_Ends">Shel Silverstein reference</a>)</em>.</p>
<h4>VID DSL: should it allow to override already defined actors (e.g.  <code>base on-down [probe 1] [probe 2]</code> )?</h4>
<p>N/A</p>
<h4>Core: how to solve inelegancies and dangers of  <code>error? try</code> ,  <code>attempt</code>  and  <code>catch</code>  on  <em>arbitrary</em>  code?</h4>
<p>As usual, it is hiiamboris asking the good questions!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>UPDATE 2022: <em>Ren-C has an answer</em> with <a href="../../fail-vs-return-fail-the-new-age-of-definitional-failures/1852.html">"Definitional Failures"</a></strong> <img src="../../../images/emoji/twitter/boom.png%3Fv=9" title=":boom:" class="emoji" alt=":boom:"></p>
<p>When originally writing this post in June 2020 all I said was that it was clear <em>"that conventional error-trapping should not conflate things that arise from "typos" with explicitly raised errors"</em>.</p>
<p>But I'm proud to say that yet another difficult question has been resolved with ^META/isotopic solutions (which during my brief conversations with Boris he did not appreciate, and I felt the dismissive attitude to another member of the Red audience was not worth trying to push through, vs. other uses of time).</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Web: how should cached versions of remote files be named (considering user-friendliness, pathname length, sanitization of invalid chars)?</h4>
<p>Beyond the scope of current concerns, and likely not all that relevant as the main target is Wasm.</p>
<h4>Core: should operators use the result from funcs with literal arguments? (if  <code>f: func [:x][x * 2]</code> , should  <code>f 1 + 2</code>  be equivalent to  <code>(f 1) + 2</code> ?)</h4>
<p>Yes.  I won't delve into details on this esoteric (-seeming) point...other than to say that several features I'm very pleased with depend on this behavior.  <em>(For example: <a href="https://forum.rebol.info/t/soft-quoted-branching-light-elegant-fast/1020">soft-quoted branching</a>.)</em>  I find no compelling points in any counter-argument worth sacrificing the related features.</p>
<h4>Core: should percent type allow scientific notation, and should it be constrained in range?</h4>
<p>Don't care.</p>
<h4>VID DSL: should  <code>panel</code>  face draw a  <code>text</code>  facet on it?</h4>
<p>N/A</p>
<h4>Core: do we want  <code>/deep</code>  refinement for  <code>take</code> ?</h4>
<p>Doesn't seem like the worst idea.  But I think the better angle is just to make sure that even if TAKE didn't have it, that someone who wanted it could make it easily.  So <a href="../../augment-add-parameters-and-refinements-after-the-fact/1216.html">features like AUGMENT</a> are geared in this direction.</p>
<h1>Historical questions &amp; explanations</h1>
<h4>Arguments on why paths evaluate picked items (so-called active accessors)</h4>
<p>It's a reasonable-sounding argument that it is "unlikely" that you want <strong>block/1</strong> to run the first function in a block.  But mechanically it's the simpler-seeming rule.  I guess it folds into a large part of the sketchiness that is path-processing.  <img src="../../../images/emoji/twitter/man_shrugging.png%3Fv=9" title=":man_shrugging:" class="emoji" alt=":man_shrugging:"></p>
<p>I will say that Ren-C's "get-pathing" and PICK-ing, and "set-pathing" and POKE-ing, are unified and run under the same dispatcher.  So <strong>:path/1</strong> and <strong>pick path 1</strong> are the same, and <strong>:path/x</strong> and <strong>pick path 'x</strong> are the same, for whatever those things happen to be.  There's not a separate codebase for getting paths from PICK or setting paths from POKE.  Hence it's called "path picking" and not "path selection".</p>
<h4>Command line argument parsing rules</h4>
<p><a href="https://github.com/metaeducation/ren-c/issues/996">This previously crossed my radar.</a>  If they do the work of writing test cases, sounds great.  Better them than me.</p>
<h4>Why word and a single-word path are different (despite the visual similarity)</h4>
<p>They shouldn't be, and single-word PATH!s should be outlawed...as WORD!s with all spaces are.  Ren-C has implemented PATH! immutability (at the "top level")...which isn't that unprecedented, as it makes them more parallel to TUPLE!.  By making paths immutable, it's possible to enforce a set of rules on them at the time of their creation (e.g. no PATH!s in their top level, that aren't inside GROUP!s, no FILE!s or URL!s, just GROUP!s/BLOCK!s/WORD!s/INTEGER!s etc.).</p>
<p>If this sounds constraining, consider the WORD! analogy again.  Making a PATH! with a PATH! in it like having a WORD! with a slash in it.  When things are immutable you have a moment of creation to enforce your check and then you just don't worry about it.  It works for WORD!, why not PATH!?</p>
<p>(You can still cheaply alias PATH!s via AS to get a BLOCK!...but the BLOCK! you get is simply read-only.  With "UTF-8 Everywhere" you can also alias WORD! as a string via AS, but once again the resulting value will be read-only.  <a href="../../as-binary-view-of-strings-is-back-with-utf-8-thats-only-part/1186.html">You can even alias them all as BINARY!</a>, as in Rebol2.  :-P)</p>
<p>The idea that PATH!s are some kind of generic "ANY-BLOCK!" is not all that compelling.  DocKimbel himself has complained about people wanting long or multi-line paths.  If you really want to mutate a path freely and promise not to end in a bad state, then COPY AS BLOCK! your path...muck with it, and then AS PATH! it (which will mark the underlying array read only, and do an integrity check that you didn't reduce it to one word).</p>
<p><em>(Overall this ties into great work done in Ren-C on PATH!, which includes generalizing REFINEMENT! so there isn't just <strong><code>/a</code></strong> but also <strong><code>a/</code></strong> and <strong><code>a//b</code></strong> ... a BLANK! in a PATH! is simply not rendered.  The immutability of paths means that even though <strong><code>/a</code></strong> is a 2-element path with a blank in the first slot, it can still be represented in one cell and not worry about being unable to handle mutations.  See <a href="../../heart-bytes-explained/1008.html">Heart <img src="../../../images/emoji/twitter/heart.png%3Fv=9" title=":heart:" class="emoji" alt=":heart:"> Bytes</a>)</em></p>
<h4>Core: :get-word function argument evaluation semantics: R2- or R3-like? (final?)</h4>
<p>There absolutely has to be <em>some</em> way to literally get a symbol/value in the position, regardless of what it looks up to.  I don't know if I'm in love with the notation for <strong>:x</strong> for unescapable quoting and <strong>'x</strong> for escapable quoting, but that's a different question.</p>
<h4>Core: how to allow maps to have  <code>none</code>  values?</h4>

              <p>So 2 years have passed and I do like to check in on things, so I thought I'd look to see if they'd updated the wiki...and to update any of my own answers.  <em>(The return result of ANY [] has changed to a void isotope, so I linked to that post, but the rest is about the same.)</em></p>

<p>No comment, though when you start talking about enhancing features of maps I do often think about being able to get at a [key value] pair as a reified concept in its own right.  C++ added some <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/map/extract">map extract</a> features that were kind of like what I'd been thinking about.</p>
<p>Concretizing maps so they are made out of "pair bricks" might deoptimize them, but it might make them more useful and meaningfully enumerable.</p>
<p>Anyway, tangential.  I don't know what kinds of operators you should be able to have on MAP! and am more concerned about the unexplained/unmotivated dichotomy between MAP! and OBJECT!.</p>

<p>Ren-C's vocabulary is so much more nuanced that it's hard to say much here.</p>
<p>Not only that, I don't really have all the answers--as Sea of Words is relatively new, and is a whole new model of what "attached variables" are (that know what module they live in, but have no storage behind them).</p>
<p>But I think we all agree that you have to have some way to catch typos.</p>

<p>We offer both options in Ren-C.  If you use a plain word, you get a new binding.  A new variable is created which doesn't overwrite the other one:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; x: 10

&gt;&gt; for-each x [1 2 3] [print x]
1
2
3

&gt;&gt; print [x]
== 10
</code></pre>
<p>If you use a QUOTED! word, it's assumed you mean to use an existing binding...and no new variable is created:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; x: 10

&gt;&gt; for-each 'x [1 2 3] [print x]
1
2
3

&gt;&gt; print [x]
== 3
</code></pre>
<p>It's better to make it a property of the symbol than a refinement (like WiseGenius's suggestion of /local).  This way you can mix and match.</p>
<p>It's a convention that's applied multiple places, including LET.</p>
<pre><code>    let [value error]
    [value position error]: transcode data  ; awkward

    let [value 'position error]: transcode data  ; better
</code></pre>
<p>At first it was speculative to do it this way.  But I'd say it's now become entrenched as a pretty good idea.</p>

<p>Arguments on why paths evaluate picked items (so-called active accessors)</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The new proposed semantics to deal with actions not always running by default would knock down yet another item off this list:</p>
<p><a href="../../big-alien-proposal-refinements-run-functions/1905.html" class="inline-onebox">Big Alien Proposal ðŸ›¸ "/REFINEMENTS" Run Functions</a></p>
<p>You only get an action dispatched if you use a PATH! form of access, like <strong><code>obj/accessor</code></strong> or <strong><code>/obj.data</code></strong>.</p>
<p>If you say <strong><code>obj.accessor</code></strong> and it was declared as <strong><code>/accessor:</code></strong> you will get an error, and you'll also get an error if you say <strong><code>obj/data</code></strong> and it was declared as <strong>data:</strong></p>
<p>Not quite sure, but I think that if you say <strong>/obj.accessor</strong> that would likely be allowed.</p>
<p>When picking from things like BLOCK!, no functions would ever run if you used TUPLE!-oriented accesses, you'd only get them by value.  You'd have to use something like <strong><code>/block.1</code></strong> to get a function to run if it was in a block.</p>
