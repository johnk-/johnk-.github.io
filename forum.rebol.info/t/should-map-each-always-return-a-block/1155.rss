    <title>Should MAP-EACH Always Return A Block?</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/should-map-each-always-return-a-block/1155</link>
    <description>I was trying to do something in JavaScript, going character by character and replacing text in a string.  JS strings are immutable so it was kind of annoying.

It made me wish to be able to do a MAP-EACH on a TEXT! and have the body return either a NULL, a CHAR!, or a TEXT!... and then produce a TEXT! from the output:

    &gt;&gt; map-each c &quot;123&quot; [
         case c [
             #&quot;1&quot; [&quot;one&quot;]
             #&quot;3&quot; [#&quot;T&quot;]
         ]  ; don&#39;t have any match for 2, so fall through with null
    ]
    == &quot;oneT&quot;

Not only does that seem useful, but it seems a bit wasteful to always be producing a BLOCK! from a large text string, then merging it together. 

But perhaps the [argument made against /INTO](https://forum.rebol.info/t/stopping-the-into-virus/705/2?u=hostilefork) applies here too...that producing a block is the more generic option, that lets you choose your coalescing step.  (Did you want SPACED, UNSPACED...something more complex?)

Certainly blocks are the most generic option.</description>

<p>Your intuition is likely right here, that since strings aren't tokenized the way blocks are, it will be a rare occasion where you want to map character-by-character to either nothing, another character, or a series of characters.  You're more likely to be looking for patterns like "&amp;nbsp", where this kind of code doesn't get you remotely what you want:</p>
<pre><code> wtf: map-each [amp n b s p semi] str [
     all [
         amp = #"&amp;"  ; only first char guaranteed set :-/
         :n = #"n"
         :b = #"b"
         :s = #"s"
         :p = #"p"
         :semi = #";"
     ] then [
         space
     ] else [
         unspaced [amp :n :b :s :p :semi]  ; up to 6 other chars
     ]
 ]  ; crazypants: only replaces &amp;nbsp; every 6 characters...
</code></pre>
<p>Having a window jumping N characters ahead across text is only going to probably come up in programming puzzles.  The case I had actually was N=1, though, which <em>did</em> come up in practice...and you can imagine it accruing state or making some other decisions for <em>some</em> scenarios.</p>
