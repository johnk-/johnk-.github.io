Around 2015 DocKimbel asked if I would look into the idea of designing a C/C++ API for Red.  Since Red was incomplete at the time, I built it as an abstraction layer over either Rebol or Red... and used Rebol for my tests and demos.

Once I had the API I thought it would be neat to do something with it.  So I built a GUI console in Qt.

Looking back at it, the demo was actually pretty impressive.  Qt is pretty good for writing this kind of thing, so I was able to put it together--both the API and the console--in about a month:
