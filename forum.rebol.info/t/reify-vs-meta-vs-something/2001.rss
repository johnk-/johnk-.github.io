    <title>REIFY vs. META vs. SOMETHING</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/reify-vs-meta-vs-something/2001</link>
    <description>Originally I suggested that REIFY of an isotope would give its plain form, and you would META it if you wanted a quasiform:

[quote=&quot;hostilefork, post:1, topic:1989&quot;]
* The generic and reversible way to make them real it is to META them and get `~true~` and `~false~` quasiforms, which you can UNMETA back to the isotopes
* The readable way to make them real is to REIFY them and get `true` and `false` as plain WORD!, which only gets turned back into the isotope form if they are bound to variables that hold the isotopes, and you evaluate them.
[/quote]

*But that&#39;s not a full coverage answer.* 

* An operator that takes everything &quot;one level up&quot;, where isotopes become quasiforms and everything else gets a quote level added.

      &gt;&gt; true
      == ~true~  ; isotope

      &gt;&gt; meta true
      == ~true~

      &gt;&gt; meta 10
      == &#39;10

* An operator that leaves non-isotopes as they are, but turns isotopes into their quasiforms (and I think this probably is best called REIFY):

      &gt;&gt; true
      == ~true~  ; isotope

      &gt;&gt; reify true
      == ~true~

      &gt;&gt; reify 10
      == 10

* An operator that leaves non-isotopes as they are, but turns isotopes into their plain forms:

      &gt;&gt; true
      == ~true~  ; isotope

      &gt;&gt; something true
      == true

      &gt;&gt; something 10
      == 10

Specifically for ACTION! isotopes being turned into plain actions, I used an interim term UNRUN, but that&#39;s pretty awful.

Making things into isotopes is done with ISOTOPIC:

    &gt;&gt; isotopic 10
    == ~10~  ; isotope

It could be a refinement to REIFY, like REIFY/PLAIN.  But at that point it could be two steps that might be clearer: NOQUASI REIFY, where NOQUASI would be like NOQUOTE and not complain if the thing you passed it was not a quasiform.

Maybe... CONCRETIZE?  That sounds like it might do a bit more work than what REIFY does :-/

    &gt;&gt; true
    == ~true~  ; isotope

    &gt;&gt; concretize true
    == true

    &gt;&gt; concretize 10
    == 10

It&#39;s not awful.  Main thing is just to have *a* name for it while the gears turn.  But as usual, throw out suggestions if you have them...</description>
