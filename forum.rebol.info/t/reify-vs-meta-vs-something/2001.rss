    <title>REIFY vs. META vs. SOMETHING</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/reify-vs-meta-vs-something/2001</link>
    <description>Originally I suggested that REIFY of an isotope would give its plain form, and you would META it if you wanted a quasiform:

[quote=&quot;hostilefork, post:1, topic:1989&quot;]
* The generic and reversible way to make them real it is to META them and get `~true~` and `~false~` quasiforms, which you can UNMETA back to the isotopes
* The readable way to make them real is to REIFY them and get `true` and `false` as plain WORD!, which only gets turned back into the isotope form if they are bound to variables that hold the isotopes, and you evaluate them.
[/quote]

*But that&#39;s not a full coverage answer.* 

* An operator that takes everything &quot;one level up&quot;, where isotopes become quasiforms and everything else gets a quote level added.

      &gt;&gt; true
      == ~true~  ; isotope

      &gt;&gt; meta true
      == ~true~

      &gt;&gt; meta 10
      == &#39;10

* An operator that leaves non-isotopes as they are, but turns isotopes into their quasiforms (and I think this probably is best called REIFY):

      &gt;&gt; true
      == ~true~  ; isotope

      &gt;&gt; reify true
      == ~true~

      &gt;&gt; reify 10
      == 10

* An operator that leaves non-isotopes as they are, but turns isotopes into their plain forms:

      &gt;&gt; true
      == ~true~  ; isotope

      &gt;&gt; something true
      == true

      &gt;&gt; something 10
      == 10

Specifically for ACTION! isotopes being turned into plain actions, I used an interim term UNRUN, but that&#39;s pretty awful.

Making things into isotopes is done with ISOTOPIC:

    &gt;&gt; isotopic 10
    == ~10~  ; isotope

It could be a refinement to REIFY, like REIFY/PLAIN.  But at that point it could be two steps that might be clearer: NOQUASI REIFY, where NOQUASI would be like NOQUOTE and not complain if the thing you passed it was not a quasiform.

Maybe... CONCRETIZE?  That sounds like it might do a bit more work than what REIFY does :-/

    &gt;&gt; true
    == ~true~  ; isotope

    &gt;&gt; concretize true
    == true

    &gt;&gt; concretize 10
    == 10

It&#39;s not awful.  Main thing is just to have *a* name for it while the gears turn.  But as usual, throw out suggestions if you have them...</description>

</aside>
<p>After pushing various problems around: <strong><em>I think it has turned out that this operation is more useful in practice</em> ...and likely deserves the coveted term "REIFY".</strong></p>
<p>In particular, I think it may be the answer to passing isotopic actions as parameters in a way that conflates with plain actions, yet canonizes it to plain.  e.g. the <strong><code>&lt;reify&gt;</code></strong> tag could indicate a desire to turn isotopic actions into non-isotopic ones if passed.  But it would be generic.  If you use it you mean you want anything passed to arrive in its reified form.</p>
<pre><code> func [arg [block!] /predicate [&lt;reify&gt; action!]] [...]
</code></pre>
<p>That feels like a pretty intelligent solution to the problem, while being generic enough to be useful for other purposes.</p>
<p>The other operation (which I called REIFY above) would be what needed a name.  Maybe it's a parameter to META, something like a META/ISOTOPE or similar.  I'll keep thinking, but I don't think it's going to be needed very often...whereas the sense of REIFY I'm talking about here is actually showing up a lot of places.</p>

There is a tab for antonyms as well. That would lead me to suggestions NEGLECT, OBSCURE or IGNORE.<br>

<p>A shorter word would be CONCRETE.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; true
== ~true~  ; isotope

&gt;&gt; concrete true
== true

&gt;&gt; concrete 10
== 10
</code></pre>
<p>We do mess a bit with wording, but here it would be more of an adjective.</p>
<p><strong>Another big question is what the antonym of REIFY would be.</strong>  That is to say something that leaves all input values alone except for quasi forms, and gives you back an isotope.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; unreify first [~alpha~ 1020]
== ~alpha~  ; isotope

&gt;&gt; unreify second [~alpha~ 1020]
== 1020
</code></pre>
<p>Unfortunately, there's not a good opposite word for REIFY.  Maybe DEGRADE?</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; degrade first [~alpha~ 1020]
== ~alpha~  ; isotope

&gt;&gt; degrade second [~alpha~ 1020]
== 1020
</code></pre>
<p>The pairing of CONCRETE/ABSTRACT might be a possibility here.  I'm not sure.</p>
<p>I think I'll go with DEGRADE a while and see how I like it.  The names can be juggled around once all the necessary behaviors are assembled.</p>
