    <title>REIFY vs. META vs. SOMETHING</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/reify-vs-meta-vs-something/2001</link>
    <description>Originally I suggested that REIFY of an isotope would give its plain form, and you would META it if you wanted a quasiform:

[quote=&quot;hostilefork, post:1, topic:1989&quot;]
* The generic and reversible way to make them real it is to META them and get `~true~` and `~false~` quasiforms, which you can UNMETA back to the isotopes
* The readable way to make them real is to REIFY them and get `true` and `false` as plain WORD!, which only gets turned back into the antiform if they are bound to variables that hold the antiforms, and you evaluate them.
[/quote]

*But that&#39;s not a full coverage answer.* 

* An operator that takes everything &quot;one level up&quot;, where antiforms become quasiforms and everything else gets a quote level added.

      &gt;&gt; true
      == ~true~  ; anti

      &gt;&gt; meta true
      == ~true~

      &gt;&gt; meta 10
      == &#39;10

* An operator that leaves non-antiforms as they are, but turns antiforms into their quasiforms (and I think this probably is best called REIFY):

      &gt;&gt; true
      == ~true~  ; isotope

      &gt;&gt; reify true
      == ~true~

      &gt;&gt; reify 10
      == 10

* An operator that leaves non-antiforms as they are, but turns antiforms into their plain forms:

      &gt;&gt; true
      == ~true~  ; isotope

      &gt;&gt; something true
      == true

      &gt;&gt; something 10
      == 10

Specifically for FRAME! antiforms (actions) being turned into plain FRAME!, I used an interim term UNRUN, but that&#39;s pretty awful.

It could be a refinement to REIFY, like REIFY/PLAIN.  But at that point it could be two steps that might be clearer: NOQUASI REIFY, where NOQUASI would be like NOQUOTE and not complain if the thing you passed it was not a quasiform.

Maybe... CONCRETIZE?  That sounds like it might do a bit more work than what REIFY does :-/

    &gt;&gt; true
    == ~true~  ; anti

    &gt;&gt; concretize true
    == true

    &gt;&gt; concretize 10
    == 10

It&#39;s not awful.  A shorter word would be CONCRETE.

    &gt;&gt; true
    == ~true~  ; anti

    &gt;&gt; concrete true
    == true

    &gt;&gt; concrete 10
    == 10

We do mess a bit with wording, but here it would be more of an adjective.

**Another big question is what the antonym of REIFY would be.**  That is to say something that leaves all input values alone except for quasi forms, and gives you back an antiform.

    &gt;&gt; unreify first [~alpha~ 1020]
    == ~alpha~  ; anti

    &gt;&gt; unreify second [~alpha~ 1020]
    == 1020

Unfortunately, there&#39;s not a good opposite word for REIFY.  Maybe DEGRADE?

    &gt;&gt; degrade first [~alpha~ 1020]
    == ~alpha~  ; anti

    &gt;&gt; degrade second [~alpha~ 1020]
    == 1020

I think I&#39;ll go with DEGRADE a while and see how I like it.  The names can be juggled around once all the necessary behaviors are assembled.</description>

<p>I think <strong><code>(noquasi reify ...)</code></strong> and <strong><code>(reify/noquasi ...)</code></strong>  (soon to be <code>reify:noquasi</code>) are probably about as good as this gets.</p>
<p>One argument against providing both is that it's cleaner.  Another is that <a href="https://forum.rebol.info/t/intrinsics-functions-without-frames/2050">a function with one argument and no refinements can be an intrinsic</a>.  So having just <strong><code>noquasi reify</code></strong> would be faster than path (chain) dispatch, as well as speed up all REIFY operations.</p>

<p>No one will know what that means.  If you're in a script where you're saying <strong><code>noquasi reify</code></strong> over and over so often it's creating problems you can define it however you like (<strong><code>nqr: get $noquasi/reify</code></strong>)</p>
<p>Maybe not everything needs a single word.</p>
