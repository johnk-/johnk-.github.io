    <title>Q: Should ~ Be The Unevaluated Form of VOID ?</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/q-should-be-the-unevaluated-form-of-void/1915</link>
    <description>*Void is an elusive concept.  Reasoning about it is difficult.  But it&#39;s one of the things that makes the evaluator special, and there are tons of creative applications.  So it&#39;s worth the effort.*

Tonight the thought crossed my mind (certainly not for the first time) that in the generalized isotope world, we might say that ~ is the isotopic form of void:

    &gt;&gt; ^(comment &quot;Hi&quot;)
    == ~

    &gt;&gt; 1 + 2 ~
    == 3

    &gt;&gt; x: ~
    ; void

    &gt;&gt; x
    ** Error: X is void (a.k.a. the variable is not set)

    &gt;&gt; unset? &#39;x  ; asks &quot;is the variable unset&quot; (there is no UNSET!) type
    == #[true]

This has the somewhat questionable property that the traditional GET/ANY of such a variable would be invisible rather than raise an alarm:

    &gt;&gt; var: ~
    ; void 

    &gt;&gt; compose [&lt;a&gt; (get/any &#39;var) &lt;b&gt;]
    == [&lt;a&gt; &lt;b&gt;]

This still makes me uneasy, because it doesn&#39;t feel &quot;ornery&quot; enough.  You have a variable that may have potentially never been set, and are being very quiet about its usage.  I&#39;d prefer people purposefully store NULL in their variables, and then use MAYBE on the NULL to make a VOID.  That&#39;s cleaner and more intentional.

But Rebol2/Red/R3-Alpha would say this is not a problem, all of them give this answer:

    redbol&gt;&gt; unset &#39;var

    redbol&gt;&gt; compose [&lt;a&gt; (get/any &#39;var) &lt;b&gt;]
    == [&lt;a&gt; &lt;b&gt;]

*(Of course, in their world, #[unset] could legally be put in blocks...so they&#39;re missing a possibility here.  Ren-C&#39;s situation isn&#39;t as bad, but still bothers me.)*

Someone might say I&#39;m being too uptight, and this is fine.

## But... There&#39;s Other Implications

Consider another case:

    &gt;&gt; all [&lt;a&gt; &lt;b&gt; if false [&lt;c&gt;]]
    == &lt;b&gt;  ; this is today&#39;s behavior with void IF FALSE, and considered correct

    &gt;&gt; all [&lt;a&gt; &lt;b&gt; x: if false [&lt;c&gt;]]
    == &lt;b&gt;  ; today this is different, X becomes unset (&quot;none&quot; isotope) and error

    &gt;&gt; x
    ** Error: X is void (a.k.a. the variable is not set)

You might ask why the following should be an error, if it wouldn&#39;t be an error if the assignment is inside the ALL:

    &gt;&gt; x: if false [&lt;c&gt;]
    &gt;&gt; all [&lt;a&gt; &lt;b&gt; x]
    ** Error: X is void (a.k.a. the variable is not set)

Also: the evaluator mechanics become more inefficient if you&#39;re expected to preserve invisibility across an assignment.  You&#39;ll kind of have to take my word on that, but it&#39;s happier if we don&#39;t do this:

    &gt;&gt; 1 + 2 [a b c]: call-void-multireturn arg1 arg2
    == 3

This means that the cell holding the 3 is not available for scratch use by things like the SET-WORD! or multi-return.

But beyond the mechanics, something about the assignment makes me feel like there&#39;s kind of a &quot;wall&quot; there.  I don&#39;t know if my feeling is justified, but it does seem like it might be justified when I say you cannot assign voids to variables.

## You&#39;ll Still Need A &quot;Nothing&quot; Isotope

When ~ was a &quot;BAD-WORD! with no name&quot;, I called its isotopic form &quot;none&quot;.  If ~ was the meta of void, there really isn&#39;t any such thing as a &quot;~ isotope&quot;.  You can never make one, because it needs to vaporize.

So in the first cut of generic isotopes, I said ~ was the isotopic form of BLANK! (as opposed to ~_~, which looks pretty bad).  And it became the new none...since no more BAD-WORD! meant a BAD! WORD! had to follow all the rules of words (no null spellings).

You can re-read my **[explanation of why void is a bad return value for things like PRINT or HELP.](https://forum.rebol.info/t/why-isnt-print-invisible-void/1466/4?u=hostilefork)**  If you want to communicate to the console that it not print anything, then you need to do that communication through some kind of non-void thing, otherwise that signal is too slippery.

So the &quot;none&quot; concept of a ~ isotope felt like a good pick.  It&#39;s the ornery contents of an unset variable, it has no string label or otherwise that&#39;s being suppressed when it&#39;s not shown...so it feels like a natural for the purpose.

## Could We Pick A New UNSET?

If ~ were retaken for the specific purpose of representing a void isotope, we&#39;d need some other answer for what an unset variable looked like.  I&#39;ve mentioned that I&#39;m pretty attached to **`~`** for how clean it looks, letting you see the things you&#39;ve set and haven&#39;t:

    &gt;&gt; f: make frame! :append

    &gt;&gt; f.dup: 2
    &gt;&gt; f.value: &quot;a string&quot;

    &gt;&gt; f
    == make frame! [
        series: ~
        value: &quot;a string&quot;
        part: ~
        dup: 2
        line: ~
    ]

If ~ represented voids and we had to change these to a new representation for blank isotopes, that would look significantly crappier:

    &gt;&gt; f
    == make frame! [
        series: ~_~
        value: &quot;a string&quot;
        part: ~_~
        dup: 2
        line: ~_~
    ]

We could go back to a full word:

    &gt;&gt; f
    == make frame! [
        series: ~unset~
        value: &quot;a string&quot;
        part: ~unset~
        dup: 2
        line: ~unset~
    ]

But it&#39;s not just in these printouts, it&#39;s also in source.  Being able to simply type **`(x: ~)`** to unset a variable and have that be the right way to do it...in an object field or just in code, is just too good.

This makes me feel pretty attached to the idea that ~ is the contents of an unset variable, which is not displayed by the terminal, and which is ornery to things like ANY or ALL, and it&#39;s called &quot;NONE&quot;.</description>

<h2>So "Unset Variables" Are Now Void</h2>
<p>^META of void is the <strong>~</strong> quasiform, which is quasi NULL</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; quasi null
== ~

&gt;&gt; meta void
== ~

&gt;&gt; 1 + 2 ~
== 3
</code></pre>
<p>There's a special exemption in variable assignment to allow the assign of void</p>
<p>Then "none"--the invisible result we don't print in the evaluator--is isotopic BLANK!.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; mold quasi blank
== ~_~

&gt;&gt; unmeta quasi blank  ; will print nothing, because console ignores it

&gt;&gt; none  ; shorthand for constructing nones
</code></pre>
<p>It's ugly, but why worry about what it looks like if it doesn't get printed out?  <img src="https://forum.rebol.info/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

</code></pre>
<p>This still makes me uneasy, because it doesn't feel "ornery" enough. You have a variable that may have potentially never been set, and are being very quiet about its usage.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I think it turns out that on the whole, being able to store void in variables gives the system a missing completeness.  It becomes roundabout when you can't.  If we think it's too easy to get void variables then that could be a special parameter, like <strong>get/any/void 'var</strong></p>
<p>I'll say that mechanically it was hard to figure out <em>how</em> to store voids in variables.  Think about it: if every time you write a void all it does is leave whatever's in the cell there, then "voids aren't values".</p>
<p>But as the system-wide support of voids expanded, the evaluator got more clever.  It has a running notion of whether a frame output cell is stale--where it can recover the output if no further evaluations are non-void.  Yet it can also tell if something has never been written.  So if something has never been written and is stale, then you can write this state into variables as well.</p>
<p>It's looking good now... with ~ being the meta of void and ' being the meta of null.  They both share the same "heart" signal (0 byte), and voids are basically null isotopes.  It works out well.</p>

<h2>I noticed that this doesn't really hold water, for a few reasons.</h2>
<p>Sometimes multi-returns want to pipe the result, and don't even name a variable for the main output... they're just writing to secondary variables:</p>
<pre><code>foo: func [return: [...] secondary: [...] ...] [
    ...
    return [# secondary]: bar ...
]
</code></pre>
<p>That's a clear case where you don't want to distort the output, because you're piping it.</p>
<p>And I don't think being a variable there should make a difference.</p>
<p>Consider also this:</p>
<pre><code>x: y: if false [...]
</code></pre>
<p>If the Y silently tolerates the assignment, but Y gets unset and propagates out a none (BLANK! isotope, contents of unset variables) then the X assignment will fail.  It doesn't seem like if one succeeds that the other should not.</p>
<p>As a general rule, I think <strong>x: y: ...</strong> should result in <strong>x = y</strong></p>
