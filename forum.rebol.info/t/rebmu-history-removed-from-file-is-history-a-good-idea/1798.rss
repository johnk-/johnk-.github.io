    <title>Rebmu History Removed from File (is History: a good idea?)</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/rebmu-history-removed-from-file-is-history-a-good-idea/1798</link>
    <description>When I started Rebmu I followed along the pattern of having seen people put **`History:`** in the headers of files.  And as it got longer, I kind of questioned the value of it.

I&#39;m not sure what the &quot;best practices&quot; for history is, but it&#39;s a lot of stuff to skip over when you&#39;re trying to get to the meat of a file.  It warrants its own discussion topic (which I guess can be discussed here, with the extracted history).

    History: [
        0.1.0 [10-Jan-2010 {Sketchy prototype written to cover only the
        Roman Numeral example I worked through when coming up with the
        idea.  So very incomplete, more a proof of concept.}]

        0.2.0 [22-Jun-2010 {Language more complete, includes examples.
        Ditched concept of mushing symbols like + and - into single
        character operators is removed due to realization that A+
        B+ C+ etc. are more valuable in the symbol space than one
        character for AD.}]

        0.3.0 [24-Jun-2010 {Made backwards compatible with Rebol 2.
        Note that things like CN for continue or PERCENTAGE! datatype
        were added in Rebol 3.  You can use these in your Rebmu programs
        but they will only work if using Rebmu with an r3 interpreter.
        Also did several name tweaks like instead of AA for AND~ it&#39;s
        now A~ along with other consistencies.}]

        0.5.0 [16-Feb-2014 {Version bump to indicate growing maturity
        of the language.  Abandon Rebol 2 support.  Rebmu files now
        have proper Rebol ecology headers.}]

        0.6.0 [6-Apr-2014 {Large cleanup creating incompatibility with
        most all previous Rebmu code solutions.  Examples have been updated
        in GitHub.  Major theme was removing the custom IF/UNLESS/EITHER
        implementation and some clearer names.}]

        0.7.0 [15-Sep-2015 {Project revisited to incorporate new ideas and
        decisions from the Ren/C effort.  Incorporates the rebol-proposals
        module to work with experimental language features instead of
        having its own &quot;incubator&quot; project.  &quot;Mu library&quot; features removed
        in favor of embracing the language default more closely.}]
