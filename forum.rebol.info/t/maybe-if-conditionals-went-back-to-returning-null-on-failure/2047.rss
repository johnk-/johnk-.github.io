    <title>MAYBE IF conditionals went back to returning NULL on Failure?</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/maybe-if-conditionals-went-back-to-returning-null-on-failure/2047</link>
    <description>A while ago, I made void more friendly... to say that void variables could be fetched without using GET-WORD! access or other fanfare:

    &gt;&gt; x: void

    &gt;&gt; append [a b c] x
    == [a b c]

My rationale was something along the lines of *&quot;well, if you make a void variable, then you get what you were asking for&quot;*.

A little bit unsettling is how easy you can make voids if something like your branches in a CASE or SWITCH are not exhaustive.  For instance:

    lib: switch config.platform [
        &#39;Windows [%windows.lib]
        &#39;Linux [%linux.a]
    ]

You&#39;ve now got LIB as VOID.  It&#39;s a little uncomfortable for me to think about how such casual creation of voids makes a thing that will go around opting out of things, but those opt-outs produce NULL via the void-in-null-out protocol, so you should find out about it eventually.  My other argument was that if you didn&#39;t want this, then you should just throw in a FAIL at the ending:

    lib: switch config.platform [
        &#39;Windows [%windows.lib]
        &#39;Linux [%linux.a]
        fail  ; not so hard to do this if you don&#39;t want VOIDs
    ]

## But...What if you *WANT* a NULL?

As it happens, due to the [SWITCH and CASE &quot;Fallout&quot; Feature](https://forum.rebol.info/t/the-fallout-from-the-switch-fallout-feature/312), this also works with things like NULL:

    lib: switch config.platform [
        &#39;Windows [%windows.lib]
        &#39;Linux [%linux.a]
        null
    ]

Basically if you give an evaluative clause with no branch, the clause drops out if it is reached.

It is *weird*, but it&#39;s foreignness doesn&#39;t necessarily make it *bad*.  Though were it a CASE statement, some people might gravitate toward an always-TRUE branch as not violating the structure:

    lib: case [
        config.platform = &#39;Windows [%windows.lib]
        config.platform = &#39;Linux [%linux.a]
        true [null]
    ]

But SWITCH has no equivalent, so its either the fallout feature or an ELSE (which won&#39;t please @rgchris and I think I prefer fallout)

    lib: switch config.platform [
        &#39;Windows [%windows.lib]
        &#39;Linux [%linux.a]
    ] else [null]

## Or Is This A Job For A VOID-TO-NULL Operator?

I thought maybe TRY could nullify-voids, but this creates conflation of disabling raised errors returned by branches.  e.g. what if the Windows branch tried to READ a nonexistent file?

    lib: try switch config.platform [
        &#39;Windows [read %windowslibname.txt]  ; imagine raises error
        &#39;Linux [%linux.a]
    ]

Not being able to open the file would conflate with not taking a branch--no good.  This shows the use of TRY to convert voids to nulls is clearly a poor idea, and that needs to be a special purpose function.

So TRY is off the table at this point; it&#39;s an ignore-raised-error-and-continue.

MAYBE makes more sense as NULL-TO-VOID and serves well in that purpose.

DEVOID is a cryptic name that was actually proposed to turn VOIDs to NIHILs for vaporization in situations that didn&#39;t naturally vaporize voids:

    &gt;&gt; 1 + 2 void

    &gt;&gt; 1 + 2 devoid void
    == 3

So I will call this something like NULLIFY-IF-VOID until a better idea comes along.  Clearly not great for everyday use.

## Or... Is This Cold Feet on Void From Failed Conditionals?

Production of voids from failed conditionals was motivated almost entirely by wanting IFs to vanish quietly when they don&#39;t take their branch.  At first it was just COMPOSE:

     &gt;&gt; compose [&lt;a&gt; (if false [&lt;b&gt;]) &lt;c&gt;]
     == [&lt;a&gt; &lt;b&gt;]

But this spread to things like REDUCE, ANY, ALL, etc.

    &gt;&gt; reduce [1 + 2 if false [30] 100 + 200]
    == [3 300]

    &gt;&gt; all [&lt;a&gt; if false [&lt;b&gt;] if true [&lt;c&gt;]]
    == &lt;c&gt;

In terms of composability and convenience, it&#39;s hard for me to think this isn&#39;t the right answer.  It feels like they get mutilated if you have to throw in a NULL-TO-VOID (what I&#39;ve called &quot;MAYBE&quot;)

    &gt;&gt; compose [&lt;a&gt; (maybe if false [&lt;b&gt;]) &lt;c&gt;]
    == [&lt;a&gt; &lt;b&gt;]

    &gt;&gt; reduce [1 + 2 maybe if false [30] 100 + 200]
    == [3 300]

    &gt;&gt; all [&lt;a&gt; maybe if false [&lt;b&gt;] maybe if true [&lt;c&gt;]]
    == &lt;c&gt;

But perhaps it&#39;s only a good answer for IF, because it has one branch and you&#39;re very aware that it takes its branch or it doesn&#39;t?  Maybe twistier constructs like SWITCH and CASE should be more conservative and evaluate to NULL when a branch isn&#39;t taken...?  :face_with_raised_eyebrow:

I don&#39;t like it for a couple of reasons, but a big one is that it feels like it throws a wrench into equivalencies.  e.g. I&#39;d like:

     unmeta* any [
         meta* if condition1 [branch1]
         meta* if condition2 [branch2]
     ]

...to be the same as:

    case [
       condition1 [branch1]
       condition2 [branch2]
    ]

Having transformations which relate constructs together means people can build on reliable parts.  The response of ANY when all expressions void out is to give a VOID, and that&#39;s by design.

So, hmm.

## ...Or Are Void Variables The Problem?

There could be some kind of rule, that variables are not allowed to hold voids...and if you assign void to a variable it becomes null.

     &gt;&gt; void? x: if false [&lt;a&gt;]
     == ~true~  ; isotope

     &gt;&gt; x
     == ~null~  ; isotope

Proposals along these lines have been entertained before.  I don&#39;t think I like it, and I feel like void variables should be legal.

## I Think I&#39;m Committed To Untaken Branches As VOID...

But as with most things here, I think the fun is letting people play language designer and making their own choices.

If pure VOID means no branch taken, you can pipe the constructs:

    case: chain [:case, :void-to-null]

And that&#39;s it.  You could choose to do this for CASE and SWITCH so they&#39;d need a MAYBE to vanish quietly, and leave IF alone.

But it&#39;s important to look at all the angles...!</description>
