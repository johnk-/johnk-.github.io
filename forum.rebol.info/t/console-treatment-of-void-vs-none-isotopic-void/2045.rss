    <title>Console Treatment of VOID vs. NONE (isotopic void)</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/console-treatment-of-void-vs-none-isotopic-void/2045</link>
    <description>Rebol2 and Red both have a console property that when the console sees an UNSET!, it prints nothing:

    &gt;&gt; block: reduce [&lt;a&gt; #[unset!] &lt;b&gt;]
    == [&lt;a&gt; unset &lt;b&gt;]  ; bad rendering, conflates #[unset!] with the word `unset`

    &gt;&gt; first block
    == &lt;a&gt;

    &gt;&gt; second block

    &gt;&gt; third block
    == &lt;b&gt;

This doesn&#39;t provide the best grounding in the console, especially considering that in their world an UNSET! is a reified value that can be found in a block.

However, returning an UNSET! is how functions like PRINT avoid outputting anything with **`==`** in the console:

    rebol2&gt;&gt; print &quot;Notice no == result&quot;
    Notice no == result

    rebol2&gt;&gt; type? print &quot;Test&quot;
    Test
    == unset!

## But What Result Should Ren-C Suppress?

Ren-C has the concept of VOID which has an isotopic form known as &quot;NONE&quot;, that is used as the unfriendly contents of an unset variable.

For educational purposes, I feel it makes the most sense to have voids not print anything, and nones print out the standard isotopic form:

    &gt;&gt; void

    &gt;&gt; quote void
    == &#39;

    &gt;&gt; quasi void
    == ~

    &gt;&gt; ~
    == ~  ; isotope

Looking at this it might seem to make a lot of sense to have functions like PRINT and HELP return VOID.

But as I explain in [&quot;Why doesn&#39;t PRINT return VOID or NIHIL&quot;](https://forum.rebol.info/t/why-doesnt-print-return-void-or-vaporize-via-nihil/1466), there is a bit of a pitfall.  Voids are friendly in terms of opting out of things:

    &gt;&gt; append [a b c] print &quot;If PRINT returned void...&quot;
    If PRINT returned void...
    == [a b c]

*This seems too friendly to me.*  There&#39;s another possibility of returning NIHIL, which would be void if no other expressions were in play...and would prohibit use as an argument.  But it would let previous results fall out:

    &gt;&gt; print &quot;If PRINT returned nihil&quot;
    If PRINT returned nihil

    &gt;&gt; append [a b c] &quot;If PRINT returned nihil&quot;
    If PRINT returned nihil
    ** Error: APPEND is missing its VALUE argument

    &gt;&gt; 1 + 2 print &quot;If PRINT returned nihil&quot;
    If PRINT returned nihil
    == 3

So returning NONE mechanically feels like it makes the most sense...it has the right amount of ornery-ness:

    &gt;&gt; print &quot;Mechanically this works best&quot;
    Mechanically this works best
    == ~  ; isotope

But it&#39;s ugly to have that **== ~  ; isotope** after every HELP or PRINT or other function.

Previously I had it so that voids printed out a comment, and nones printed nothing:

    &gt;&gt; ~

    &gt;&gt; void
    ; void

But this is making the console pretty at the cost of obfuscation.  I&#39;ll point out that the web console can make the **== ~  ; isotope** some kind of light gray so it&#39;s less noticeable.

## People Always Bend To Get What They Want...

I might not like the idea of returning a &quot;friendly&quot; void to get invisibility, and try forcing everyone to use NONE for console commands.  But if they see VOID/NIHIL as the better way to get what they want, they&#39;ll choose that in their own commands to cut down on the clutter.

It seems there&#39;s at least a rationale here for why isotopic void would output nothing, while void would give a comment.  If you consider the fact that isotopic void is &quot;less than&quot; a void, then giving it the special nothing-printed status makes some amount of sense.</description>
