    <title>What should do of empty block (`DO []`) do?</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/what-should-do-of-empty-block-do-do/1426</link>
    <description>### *(Related question: https://forum.rebol.info/t/what-should-do-of-empty-string-do-do/2035)*

---
I&#39;ve pointed out that the answer for things like &quot;what should a loop that never runs its body&quot; have varied.

    rebol2/r3-alpha&gt;&gt; type? while [false] [&quot;whatever&quot;]
    == none!

    red&gt;&gt; type? while [false] [&quot;whatever&quot;]
    == unset!

But it&#39;s consistent historically that if something runs **`do []`** then you get an &quot;UNSET!&quot;

    rebol2/r3-alpha/red&gt;&gt; type? do []
    == unset!

## New Isotopic States Available

Ren-C has a choice most corresponding to UNSET!, which is NOTHING.  [Nothing does not display in the console](https://forum.rebol.info/t/console-treatment-of-void-vs-nothing/2045), which might be considered an advantage.

    &gt;&gt; do []  ; imagine this returns NOTHING

But if you evaluate to nothing during something like REDUCE, it would give you an error.

    &gt;&gt; reduce [1 + 2 ~ 3 + 4]
    ** Script Error: Invalid use of ~ antiform

To get opt-out behavior, it would have to give VOID.

    &gt;&gt; do []
    == ~void~  ; anti

This would then be the same thing you get from a failed conditional.

    &gt;&gt; if false [&quot;a&quot;]
    == ~void~  ; anti

As well as the established result of an ANY or ALL in which all the expressions opt out.

    &gt;&gt; all [if false [&quot;hello&quot;] comment &quot;world&quot;]
    == ~void~  ; anti

**Can anyone think of a case where there&#39;s a balance of provable value for something like a `do compose [...]` whose contents have all boiled away to be NOTHING instead of VOID?**</description>

<p>There's a few interesting developments that inform the thinking on this...</p>
<h3>

</h3>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; if get/any $asdf [print "Ren-C considers NOTHING as truthy"]
Ren-C considers NOTHING as truthy
</code></pre>
<p>This decision aligns with Red's choice for UNSET! (though Rebol2 and R3-Alpha consider trying to conditionally test UNSET! as an error).</p>
<h3>
<a name="passing-nothing-to-comparison-operations-now-failshttpsforumrebolinfotmaking-call-raise-a-definitional-error-for-bad-exit-codes20682-2" class="anchor" href="https://forum.rebol.info#passing-nothing-to-comparison-operations-now-failshttpsforumrebolinfotmaking-call-raise-a-definitional-error-for-bad-exit-codes20682-2"></a><a href="https://forum.rebol.info/t/making-call-raise-a-definitional-error-for-bad-exit-codes/2068/2">Passing NOTHING to Comparison Operations Now Fails</a>
</h3>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; if (10 = get/any $asdf) [print "Not legal in Ren-C"]
** Script Error: = expects [something?] for its value2 argument
</code></pre>
<p>This decision aligns with Rebol2's treatment of UNSET! in comparisons (though Red and R3-Alpha allow it).</p>
<h3>
<a name="func-returns-nothing-unless-you-use-an-explicit-returnhttpsforumrebolinfothow-attached-are-we-to-functions-return-last-result1219-3" class="anchor" href="https://forum.rebol.info#func-returns-nothing-unless-you-use-an-explicit-returnhttpsforumrebolinfothow-attached-are-we-to-functions-return-last-result1219-3"></a><a href="https://forum.rebol.info/t/how-attached-are-we-to-functions-return-last-result/1219">FUNC returns NOTHING unless you use an explicit RETURN</a>
</h3>
<p>A side effect of this is that it's a lot harder to accidentally return VOID from a function:</p>
<pre><code> whatever: func [x [block! group!]] [
     if block? x [append x spread [a b c]]
     if group? x [append x spread [d e f]]
 ]
</code></pre>
<p>Under the historical behavior, if you pass in a GROUP! the final function result would be the branch result of the APPEND which will be the group with [d e f] added.  But if you passed in a BLOCK! then the IF GROUP? test would be false and the overall return result would be a VOID.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>FUNC Change Means The World Overall Is More Full Of Nothing</strong> - In this case it's a good thing.  The fewer accidental VOIDs that are being produced in the ecology overall, the better I feel about constructs like DO being willing to produce them, or for things like REDUCE (or anything else) being willing to discard them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>NOTHING Is In Some Ways Less Ornery</strong> - if the goal of <strong><code>do compose [...]</code></strong> when all the material vaporizes was to give back an "ornery" result, it's worth noting that NOTHING is less ornery than it used to be in conditionals (and more ornery than it used to be in comparisons).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Were you to write <strong><code>if do compose block [print "Truthy"]</code></strong> and all the expressions in BLOCK vaporized when this wasn't your intent, VOID "offer more safety" now than NOTHING</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But if you wrote <strong><code>if 10 = do compose block [print "Truthy"]</code></strong> and all the expressions in BLOCK vaporized when this wasn't your intent, NOTHING would "offer more safety" than VOID</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I know this seems silly but that's my point.  Choosing to return NOTHING for <code>do []</code> is useless... so its only theoretical value is to offer some safety on shooting yourself in the foot with VOID when something like a REDUCE'd or COMPOSE'd block decays to no elements.  But that safety seems a bit of a mirage, and also it prevents you from exploiting useful VOID results when you want that from the decay.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Which is an indication it doesn't happen on accident.  So the main way it's going to come up is if people know that's the behavior, and start designing code that purposefully uses the pattern.</p>
<p>And if they do that, then that is a good thing, because they're getting use out of it.</p>
<p>I'm happy with where it stands.</p>

<p>I'd be interested to dig into this a bit more: <em>"Redbol languages are based on denotational semantics, where the meaning of every expression needs to have a representation"</em> / <em>"I suppose he hasn't read Godel, Escher, Bach"</em>. The first statement seems quite inflexible and possibly restrictive.</p>

            <p>I hadn't pondered the absolutism of REDUCE. I've embraced your concept of vaporization for UNSPACED/SPACED/COMPOSE and don't see why REDUCE would be different.

<p>The historical rule is that nothing vaporizes by default in REDUCE.  If you have N expressions in, you will have N values out.  <a href="https://forum.rebol.info/t/why-or-why-not-have-unset-in-rebol-like-languages/113/2">There is a religiosity about it in Red</a>.</p>
<p>If you think <strong>reduce [do []]</strong> should be <strong>[]</strong> then that would require both DO [] to be VOID and REDUCE to vaporize them:</p>
<pre><code> &gt;&gt; if false ["not"]
 == ~void~  ; anti

 &gt;&gt; reduce ["Bear in mind this will" if false ["not"] "make you a Red heretic"]
 == ["Bear in mind this will" "make you a Red heretic"]

<p>I don't really think we have code examples where this comes up all that often, which is probably why it hasn't been given that much thought.</p>
<p>OTOH the REDUCE default behavior does come up, I just don't tend to use REDUCE that often compared to COMPOSE.  <strong>reduce ['x: 1 + 2]</strong> seems awkward compared to <strong>compose [x: (1 + 2)]</strong>.  So it's like the only time I would use REDUCE would be to build the "block of precisely N values", and the restriction hasn't bothered me so far.</p>
