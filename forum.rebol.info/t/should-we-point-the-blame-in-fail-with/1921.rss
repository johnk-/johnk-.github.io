    <title>Should We Point The Blame in FAIL With &quot;@&quot;?</title>

    <description>[quote=&quot;hostilefork, post:3, topic:908&quot;]
Whatever comes of @, I am eager to see it used for &quot;pointing at&quot;:

```
 func [param] [fail &quot;An error which indicates this line&quot;]
 func [param] [fail @param &quot;An error which indicates the callsite&quot;]
```
[/quote]

Over time, I&#39;ve found myself not as completely thrilled with this application as I thought I would be.  The @ looks kind of... heavy, considering that what it&#39;s doing is ultimately kind of a &quot;light&quot; pointer.

I go back and forth on it.  A light quoted word does seem nice at times:

    func [param] [fail &quot;An error which indicates this line&quot;]
    func [param] [fail &#39;param &quot;An error which indicates the callsite&quot;]
    func [param] [fail &#39;param]  ; just blame the parameter as being bad at callsite
    func [param] [fail]  ; just fail.  (blame is &lt;skip&gt;pable, reason is &lt;end&gt;able)</description>

<p>It's interesting to see that things have evolved with <a href="https://forum.rebol.info/t/repurposing-the-xxx-xxx-for-undecorated-values/2135"><code>@word</code> being the means of capturing a binding</a>, it's now nearly a requirement that we use <code>@word</code> for this purpose.</p>
<p>If we use a quoted word, then that generally (barring strange magic) would imply not capturing the binding... hence not knowing what variable to "blame" at the callsite.</p>
