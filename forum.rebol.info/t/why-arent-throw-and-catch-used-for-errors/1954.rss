    <title>Why Aren&#39;t THROW and CATCH Used For Errors?</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/why-arent-throw-and-catch-used-for-errors/1954</link>
    <description>While many languages speak of &quot;throwing&quot; and &quot;catching&quot; errors, this isn&#39;t how Rebol uses the terms.

Instead, it&#39;s a generic way to move values up the stack.  It gives you a handy &quot;out&quot; from control flow:

    result: catch [
        if condition [throw result]
        some code
        case [
            condition [more code]
            condition [more code, throw result]
        ]
        additional code
        throw result
    ]

The implementation of the feature is lightweight, and built on the same mechanic as RETURN.  You could in fact use return to do this:

    result: eval func [] [
        if condition [return result]
        some code
        case [
            condition [return code]
            condition [more code, return result]
        ]
        additional code
        return result
    ]

**You can, if you like, THROW an error... plain or raised...and CATCH it.**  But that&#39;s just because you can throw anything.  Packs are fine, too:

    &gt;&gt; [a b]: catch [
           case [
               1 = 2 [throw pack [10 20]]
               1 = 1 [throw pack [100 200]]
           ]
       ]
    == 100

    &gt;&gt; a
    == 100

    &gt;&gt; b 
    == 200

So it&#39;s really about throwing whatever you like--not specific to errors or error handling.

THROW and CATCH are a great lightweight feature for control flow, that people really should be using more often than they do.  *(Ren-C uses &quot;definitional throw&quot;, which means there&#39;s no risk of you calling a routine that would accidentally catch a throw that wasn&#39;t meant for it--which is quite important!)*

## Definitional Errors Use RAISE+TRAP

If you&#39;re dealing with [definitional errors](https://forum.rebol.info/t/fail-vs-return-raise-the-new-age-of-definitional-errors/1852), then you RAISE them and then TRAP them.

    &gt;&gt; trap [raise &#39;foo]
    == make error! [
        type: ~null~
        id: &#39;foo
        message: ~null~
        near: &#39;[raise &#39;foo **]
        where: &#39;[raise entrap trap eval catch* enrescue eval rescue console]
        file: ~null~
        line: 1
    ]

You can also use EXCEPT to trap with an infix construct:

    &gt;&gt; (raise &#39;foo) except e -&gt; [print e.id]
    == foo

But by design, definitional errors must be triaged and handled immediately when they are returned--or the antiform error will &quot;decay&quot; into an **&quot;abrupt failure&quot;**.

## Abrupt Failures use FAIL+RESCUE

Generally speaking, [it&#39;s not a good idea to react to abrupt failures](https://forum.rebol.info/t/discouraging-the-interception-of-abrupt-failures/1871) *(unless you are something like the CONSOLE, where all you are doing is reporting that the error happened.)*

As mentioned above, a raised error will decay to an abrupt failure if it isn&#39;t triaged.  But you can also cause an abrupt failure using FAIL.

*(Fun tidbit: FAIL is implemented by raising a definitional error and then not triaging it before passing it on.  Right now it passes it to NULL?, which doesn&#39;t use a meta-aware parameter convention so it forces decay to abrupt failure.  **`fail: cascade [get $raise, get $null?]`**)*

To help emphasize that you should generally not be reaching for the RESCUE routine to recover from abrupt failures, it lives in **sys.util**.

     &gt;&gt; sys.util/rescue [
           foo: func [argument] [
               return argment + 20  ; whoops, typo
           ]
           foo 1000
        ]
    == make error! [
        type: &#39;Script
        id: &#39;unassigned-attach
        message: &#39;[:arg1 &quot;word is attached to a context, but unassigned&quot;]
        near: &#39;[
            return argment ** + 20]
        where: &#39;[foo enrescue eval rescue eval catch* enrescue eval rescue console]
        file: ~null~
        line: 2
        arg1: &#39;argment
    ]

Hopefully it&#39;s clear to anyone--upon light reflection--why thinking you can handle abrupt failures is generally misguided!</description>
