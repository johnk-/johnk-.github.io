              <p>At this exact moment...TYPE OF any isotope is an error, while both TYPE OF NULL and TYPE OF VOID give back NULL.</p>
<p>OF is a generic operation (the enfix form of REFLECT that quotes the word on its left.  It may be desirable to honor the VOID-in-NULL out convention for all the other reflectors that aren't TYPE... and it's desirable to error on NULL more generically.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; label of null
** Error: You didn't give anything

&gt;&gt; label of maybe null  ; MAYBE NULL is VOID 
; null
</code></pre>
<p>So if <strong>type of</strong> follows the same pattern as other <strong>xxx of</strong>, we'd surmise that you don't use TYPE OF to discern NULL and VOID.  It errors on NULL input and gives you back NULL if you MAYBE it.</p>
<p>But what happens when you ask:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; spread [d e]
== ~(d e)~  ; isotope

&gt;&gt; type of spread [d e]
???
</code></pre>
<h2>The Original Plan Was <em>No</em> Arguments Received Isotopes</h2>
<p>In the original conception, function frames weren't capable of holding isotopes in the arguments.  You physically could not receive a parameter that was an isotope.</p>
<p>I was also looking at the idea that some isotope forms--such as isotopic ERROR!--would be completely impossible to get into a variable, <em>ever</em>.</p>
<p>The only workaround was if a function used the ^META parameter convention, in which case an isotope would come in as a QUASI! form of the value...while normal values would come in as quoted:</p>
<pre><code> &gt;&gt; detector: func [^x] [print ["Meta of X:" mold x]]

 &gt;&gt; detector [d e]
 Meta of X: '[d e]

 &gt;&gt; detector spread [d e]
 Meta of X: ~(d e)~
</code></pre>
<p>Ultimately I backed down on this, instead allowing you to use type filtering to narrow which isotopes you'd be willing to accept:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; splicetaker: func [x [any-value! ~group!~]] [
       append [a b c] :x
   ]

&gt;&gt; splicetaker [d e]
== [a b c [d e]]

&gt;&gt; splicetaker spread [d e]
== [a b c d e]
</code></pre>
<p>So this creates a new typeset feature that is hacked in terribly <em>(the presence of any ~xxx!~ currently means the same thing as ~any-value!~, but it's documentation for when the feature gets better)</em>.  And it means that the ^META parameter convention is basically something that can be implemented on top of this, by doing something like <strong><code>x: my meta</code></strong> at the beginning of the function.</p>
<p>A primary driver behind this change was that operations which wanted to do things like ADAPT a function frame were having to become sensitive to whether a parameter was ^META or not, and it was more of a headache than having to use the <strong>:get-word</strong> accessors on variables.  It seemed that standardizing the frame in a way that permitted isotopes as currency made more sense than having arguments be sometimes-meta'd, sometimes not.</p>
<h2>What if OF (REFLECT) Didn't Take Isotopes?</h2>
<p>So we could say that if you think you have an isotope in your hand, you're responsible for ^META-ing it yourself:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; metatyper: func [x [any-value! ~group!~]] [
       print ["Metatype of X is" type of ^x]
   ]

&gt;&gt; metatyper [d e]
== @['block]  ; the TYPE OF received a QUOTED!, so e.g. answer incorporates quoted

&gt;&gt; metatyper spread [d e]
== @[~block~]  ; got QUASI!, so TYPE OF answer incorporates quasi
</code></pre>
<p>On the plus side of such an approach, we don't have to invent any type representations for isotopes.</p>

<p>If we don't do that, we get into problems of TYPE OF serving two masters. If it gets a parameter pack, is it supposed to say that it's the type of the first item in the pack... or is it supposed to tell you it's a pack? The ^META removes the ambiguity.</p>

</aside>
<p>Devil's advocacy here <img src="../../../images/emoji/twitter/japanese_goblin.png%3Fv=9" title=":japanese_goblin:" class="emoji" alt=":japanese_goblin:">  would say that if parameter types need to be able to take isotopes, then the type mechanics have to be able to represent the "isotopic types" <em>somehow</em>.</p>
<p>And if there's a representation, there <em>would</em> be uses in usermode for it.  But it would have to be a special operator, and what it returned probably shouldn't be "a type" in the conventional sense.</p>
<p>For instance: It would be disruptive to do something like suddenly say all the types are actually "one level quoted up"...just to get this representation at quote level 0.  This would give isotopes the &amp;[~xxx~] representation, but at the cost of making everything else skew with an extra quote:</p>
<p>BAD WAY:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; type* of first [(1020)]
== &amp;['group]

&gt;&gt; type* of first [''(1020)]
== &amp;['''group]

&gt;&gt; type* of first [~(1020)~]
== &amp;['~group~]

&gt;&gt; type* of spread [d e]
== &amp;[~group~]
</code></pre>
<p>That's pretty awful and misleading, just to be able to get that last representation...which you generally wouldn't use for anything beyond comparison anyway.</p>
<h3>What if the result were itself a QUASI! of the type?</h3>
<p>BETTER WAY:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; type* of first [(1020)]
== &amp;[group]

&gt;&gt; type* of first [''(1020)]
== &amp;[''group]

&gt;&gt; type* of first [~(1020)~]
== &amp;[~group~]

&gt;&gt; type* of spread [d e]
== ~&amp;[~group~]~
</code></pre>
<p>That's some fairly outside-the-box thinking (pun intended), which keeps the other types looking appropriate for their input.  It has the nice touch that while all the <em>real</em> datatypes are unevaluative, the quasiform would evaluate into something that is sort of nasty, to show that you're probably confused.  So while it isn't an isotope (and you wouldn't want it to be) it has that going for it, still allowing its raison d'etre of comparison:</p>
<pre><code>splice!*: '~&amp;[~group~]~
activation!*: '~&amp;[~action~]~

switch type* of :x [
   splice!* [...]
   integer! [...]
   activation!* [...]
]
</code></pre>
<p>There I'm spitballing the idea that the isotopic "types" are made to stand out by having an asterisk after them.</p>
<p>(Bear in mind that this technique should ideally only come up in fairly advanced code.)</p>
<h3>These quasi forms wouldn't <em>actually</em> be a datatype...</h3>
<p>This would mean typical things designed to react to TYPE-BLOCK! wouldn't react to it.</p>
<p>But is that a bad thing?  Consider trying to use it in PARSE:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; splice!*: '~&amp;[~group~]~

&gt;&gt; parse [? ? ?] [some splice!*]
; ** What were you expecting to do with it if it WAS a datatype? **
</code></pre>
<p>You can't match it against anything you'd find in a block, only evaluative products.  No harm done in PARSE by not being a "real type".</p>
<p>On the other hand, you might imagine using it with something like MATCH:</p>
<pre><code> &gt;&gt; match splice!* spread [d e]
 == ~(d e)~  ; isotope
</code></pre>
<p>So match <em>could</em> be written to say it takes these forms (let's say we call them "isoTYPES")</p>
<pre><code>datatype!: &amp;[type-block]

isotype!: &amp;[~type-block~]

match: native [
    test [datatype! isotype! block!]
    value [any-value! any-isotope!*]
]
</code></pre>
<p>Should it go this far?  I don't know.</p>
<h3>Pragmatically, I Think We Need The TYPE* Operator</h3>
<p>I'm reluctant to see <strong><code>[any-value! any-isotope!*]</code></strong> typesets popping up everywhere.  Part of the whole religion of isotopes is that they only show up in arbitrary <em>outputs</em>, and anything that takes isotopes in will only take <em>very specific ones</em>...as an alternative to trying to slipstream that state into a refinement or something.</p>
<p>But...I've struggled with some convolutions you get when you try to write code without being able to branch on types including isotopic ones.  And as I mentioned, typesets kind of need it too in order to work internally.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>OF is a generic operation (the enfix form of REFLECT that quotes the word on its left. It's desirable to honor the VOID-in-NULL out convention for all the other reflectors that aren't TYPE... and it's desirable to error on NULL more generically.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; label of null
** Error: You didn't give anything

&gt;&gt; label of maybe null  ; MAYBE NULL is VOID 
; null
</code></pre>
<p>So if <strong>type of</strong> follows the same pattern as other <strong>xxx of</strong>, we'd surmise that you don't use TYPE OF to discern NULL and VOID. It errors on NULL input and gives you back NULL if you MAYBE it.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Above I suggest an XXX OF consistency, with TYPE OF NULL as an error and TYPE OF VOID is NULL.</p>
<p>If that were so, and TYPE* OF VOID is <em>not</em> NULL, then it would be the only case where TYPE* OF would change an answer from what the TYPE OF would say.</p>
<p>Does that suggest not allowing plain TYPE OF either NULL or VOID, and requiring you to use TYPE*, to get some kind of reified answer?  (This would introduce <strong><code>null!*</code></strong> and <strong><code>void!*</code></strong>)</p>
<p>Or does it suggest allowing NULL and not VOID?  (This would introduce <strong><code>null!</code></strong> with no <code>*</code>, and <strong><code>void!*</code></strong>)</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; type of null
== &amp;[null]

&gt;&gt; type* of null
== &amp;[null]

&gt;&gt; type of void
** Error: Use TYPE* to take type of isotopes if intentional

&gt;&gt; type* of void
== ~&amp;[null]~

<h2>But I've Always Been Uncomfortable With NULL!</h2>
<p><a href="../../revisiting-opt-in-the-func-spec-dialect/1658.html">When discussing why I made the <code>&lt;opt&gt;</code> tag instead of null!</a>, I said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If a TYPE OF operation can make a reified thing spring into existence out of the absence of a thing, I feel like something is out of whack.</p>
<p>There's a clear advantage if you're going to be chaining things.</p>
<pre><code>x: (type of select data item) else [
    fail "A reified NULL! datatype doesn't permit this kind of handling"
]
</code></pre>
<p>Though that's a more modern intuition about it; I wasn't thinking about that when <code>&lt;opt&gt;</code> was made.</p>
<p>I think one angle is that I felt like the optionalness was somehow a "big deal" and needed to jump off the page for the spec more. NULL! just blended in.</p>
<pre><code>foo: func [arg [null! integer! block!]] [...]
bar: func [arg [integer! block! group! path! null! word!]] [...]

<h2>I Dislike The Idea Of TYPE* Changing Answers</h2>
<p>Imagine you had code like this:</p>
<pre><code> switch type of (...) [
    null [...]
    integer! [...]
 ]
</code></pre>
<p>But one day you realize the input could be a splice or something, and so <code>TYPE*</code> gets swapped in:</p>
<pre><code> switch type* of (...) [
    null [...]
    integer! [...]
    splice!* [...]
 ]
</code></pre>
<p>It seems to me that the meaning of NULL should not change, all things being equal.  But things are probably not equal.</p>
<p><img src="../../../images/emoji/twitter/exploding_head.png%3Fv=9" title=":exploding_head:" class="emoji only-emoji" alt=":exploding_head:"></p>
<h2>This Is Very Aggravating... but...</h2>
<p>I think I like TYPE OF NULL being NULL</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I like it even if it breaks a pattern in XXX OF where VOID input means NULL out, and NULL input is an error</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TYPE feels like a fairly special kind of question, so it's probably okay</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Internally we need a way to put nulls and voids into typesets, and I can imagine usermode cases where this is useful as well.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If TYPE* is able to give a reified answer of NULL!* and VOID!* this would provide some uses</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This would imply that TYPE* OF NULL and TYPE OF NULL would be different answers</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It might be best to avoid a symbol in the type, to signify the weirdness of it.  But in the current design, NULL actually isn't an isotope...void is the isotope of NULL:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; type* of null
== &amp;[]

&gt;&gt; type* of void
== ~&amp;[]~
</code></pre>
<p>I suspect I'm missing something here.  But as with most things, I guess I just have to kind of try things and feel them out.</p>
<p>So what I'm going to try is a world where function parameters are powered by this <code>TYPE*</code> concept, give the same concept to usermode, and see what emerges from that.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I believe what I was missing is that really, <strong>switch type of x [...]</strong> is broken because it goes through a middle-man... some concept of "type".  You have to get a good answer for TYPE OF for everything, which you are then switching on.</p>
<p>Better is something like <strong>switch/type x [...]</strong> where <em>type constraints</em> (compositions of arbitrary functions) can power the process with access to the full value.</p>
<p>There is no special "type" for a block that contains a single word... it's just <em>"a block"</em>.  Similarly I'd say there is there is no special "type" for an isotope of a group... it's just <em>"an isotope"</em>.</p>
<p>Now we have TYPE-WORDs to capture this idea:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; type of 10
== &amp;integer

&gt;&gt; type of [a]
== &amp;block

&gt;&gt; type of first ['a]
== &amp;quoted

&gt;&gt; type of true  ; it's an isotope of the word TRUE
== &amp;isotope

&gt;&gt; type of null  ; it's an isotope of the word NULL
== &amp;isotope
</code></pre>
<p>Saying that the TYPE OF VOID is ~null~ instead of &amp;void creates a little bit of a speedbump, but would honor the void-in-null-out convention.  I can't say offhand whether it's great or not.</p>
<h2>Things like INTEGER! should probably not be TYPE-WORDs</h2>
<p>Right now in my prototype, <strong>integer!</strong> is defined as <strong>&amp;integer</strong> so you can use it in a switch statement as was done classically.  But this is likely to lead to problems, when people try to write things like:</p>
<pre><code>switch type of x [
    logic! [...]  ; can't work, logic! is &amp;(logic?), not &amp;isotope
    null! [...]  ; can't work, null! is &amp;(null?), not &amp;isotope
    even-integer! [...]  ; more obviously couldn't work
 ]
</code></pre>
<p>So I propose making <em>none</em> of the ending-in-exclamation forms work, by defining:</p>
<pre><code>integer!: &amp;(integer?)
block!: &amp;(block?)
</code></pre>
<p>They'll be type constraints that can work with <strong>match</strong> or in a function spec block.  But then anything that operates mechanically on fundamental types would use the <strong>&amp;integer</strong> form.</p>
<p>This can be made backwards compatible in bootstrap Ren-C, because it let you use ampersands in word names.  So the workaround for bootstrap would be:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; &amp;integer: integer!
== #[datatype! integer!]
</code></pre>
<p>While the &amp; forms may be a bit uglier and less familiar, the goal would be to convince people to change from <strong>switch</strong> to using <strong>match</strong> so they could use the exclamation forms...which is probably what they wanted if they wanted to test for <strong>logic!</strong> or <strong>null!</strong> etc.</p>
<h2>We May Want to Call This KIND OF vs. TYPE OF</h2>
<p>Over the long term I'm not sure what sort of type system a Redbol-type language could have.  We could imagine TYPE OF being a rich answer that came back from an &amp;object to describe its heritage.</p>
<p><strong>kind of</strong> is a little narrower than implying some elaborate type system.  It would leave TYPE OF for future use.</p>

<h2>This would be a really far reaching change...</h2>
<p>One kind of ugly-looking consequence would be that you won't be able to write things like <strong>to integer!</strong> anymore, because it will expect <strong>to &amp;integer</strong>.  Same with <strong>make &amp;object</strong> etc.</p>
<p>It's a bit jarring to look at.  Not as jarring as <strong>to #[datatype! integer!]</strong> of course, and I'd imagine one would get used to it.</p>
<p>But it has another downside... <strong>&amp;integer</strong> is a datatype literal, and this literalness makes it something that can't be as easily redefined as if it was a WORD! that was looked up to a datatype.  :-/</p>
<p>One might ask why you can't avoid naming the type constraint entirely, and always speak in terms of functions.  This means you would always have to write <strong>match [any-series?] value</strong> instead of <strong>match any-series! value</strong>.  The reasoning is that we want to be able to write things like:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; parse ["abc" [d e f]] [some any-series!]
== [d e f]
</code></pre>
<p>Since the point is to help people distinguish between actual cell types and type constraints, perhaps that could be done with another naming convention nuance?  Like two exclamation points on type constraints vs. one on fundamental types...  <strong>any-value!!</strong> and <strong>logic!!</strong> vs. <strong>integer!</strong>  ?  <img src="../../../images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png%3Fv=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; parse ["abc" [d e f]] [some any-series!!]
== [d e f]
</code></pre>
<p>Maybe the ANY is enough to give the hint, and then other type constraints could be named things like <strong>is-even!</strong> or <strong>is-splice!</strong>.  This would clue people to not write things like <strong>make is-logic! [...]</strong> or <strong>is-logic! = kind of value</strong>.</p>
<p>That might be a semi-reasonable solution to the problem: name your type constraints with a leading <strong>IS-</strong> or <strong>ANY-</strong>.  Anything without such a prefix should be left to fundamental types.</p>

<p>It may be worth pointing out that in PARSE, we <em>could</em> always encode type matching intent via a MATCH instruction, and then have it quote a block argument:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; parse ["abc" [d e f]] [some match [any-series?]]
== [d e f]
</code></pre>
<p>But then, people would probably do something like:</p>
<pre><code>any-series!: [match [any-series?]]
</code></pre>
<p>This would be usable in PARSE but not elsewhere, e.g. SWITCH/TYPE wouldn't understand it.  :-/</p>
<p>So it seems that having a "type-flavored block" to encode these sets is the better answer.  Inside that block you can use function references like ANY-SERIES? and other type flavored blocks like ANY-SERIES! interchangeably.  As written, using the function form is slightly faster.</p>

<p>Maybe the ANY is enough to give the hint, and then other type constraints could be named things like <strong>is-even!</strong> or <strong>is-splice!</strong>. This would clue people to not write things like <strong>make is-logic! [...]</strong> or <strong>is-logic! = kind of value</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The "make all typesets start with ANY-" was a very early R3-Alpha compromise on how to tell that things like SERIES! were not fundamental types.  A Rebol2 newbie might say something like <strong>make series! [...]</strong> or <strong>if series! = type-of x</strong>.  The speedbump of the ANY- would give that a broken flow that you wouldn't <em>expect</em> to work: <strong>make any-series! [...]</strong>, <strong>if any-series! = type-of x</strong></p>
<p>Now that typesets are gone and only type constraints exist, the speedbump of the <strong>is-splice!</strong> isn't making me very happy.  It may be one of those "is the cure worse than the disease" situations... <img src="../../../images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png%3Fv=12" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> In C++ when you take a parameter by reference you don't indicate syntactically whether it's a concrete or abstract class.  You just find out if you try to instantiate an instance.  Some people name "interfaces" with a leading letter <code>I</code>... in some cases you do see things like <code>class ConcreteWidget : public AbstractWidget {...}</code></p>
<p>Here's the kind of thing I'm staring at with displeasure right now:</p>
<pre><code> appender: func [series [any-series!] value [void! any-element! is-splice!]] [
     ...
 ]
</code></pre>
<p>Following the pattern of the Rebol2 universe, the failure to distinguish gives us the cleaner-<strong>but</strong>-misleading read:</p>
<pre><code> appender: func [series [series!] value [void! element! splice!]] [
     ...
 ]
</code></pre>
<p>I lament not being able to just use functions, which is now the underlying mechanic and... <em>almost too good to pass up</em>.  It reduces the redundancy of needing both things like LOGIC? as well as (IS-)LOGIC!...and though it's technically still a naming convention, it's one that's well-established:</p>
<pre><code> appender: func [series [series?] value [void! element? splice?]] [
     ...
 ]
</code></pre>
<p>If there's no <strong>splice!</strong> then people won't be tempted to write <strong>if splice! = type of x</strong> or <strong>make splice!</strong>.</p>
<p>This would mess with the SWITCH/TYPE scenarios, unless they quoted their arguments vs. running the functions:</p>
<pre><code>switch/type x [
    logic? [...]  ; want to test x to see if it's a logic...not the [...] block!
    null? [...]
    even-integer? [...]
]
</code></pre>
<p>You'd have to suppress the evaluation if not, e.g. using BLOCK!... it works for MATCH e.g. <strong>match [logic?] x</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>switch/type x [
    [logic?] [...]
    [null?] [...]
    [even-integer?] [...]
]
</code></pre>
<p>Perhaps my bias of what "TYPE-WORD!" means is off, and it should mean "call this function with one value and process the logic result":</p>
<pre><code>switch/type x [
    &amp;logic? [...]
    &amp;null? [...]
    &amp;even-integer? [...]
]
</code></pre>
<p>Foundational types could then be defined as something weirder...since you'd rarely type them out...</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; integer!
== &amp;(integer)
</code></pre>
<p>You could still define shorthands if you wanted.  <strong>is-logic!: &amp;logic?</strong> ... but it wouldn't come in the box.</p>
<p>Re-examining basing switch/type (or whatever that construct is called) take blocks doesn't actually <em>look</em> so bad... but there's a mechanical problem in that SWITCH has historically used blocks to indicate where the code was for common switch conditions, that would break down:</p>
<pre><code>switch/type x [
    block! group! [...]
    [even-integer?] [logic?] [...]
]
</code></pre>
<p>I have proposed addressing this with commas... which comes off as kind of annoying:</p>
<pre><code>switch/type x [
    block!, group! [...]
    [even-integer?], [logic?] [...]
]
</code></pre>
<p>Other languages throw in more syntax, which people like Shixin have expressed favored for clarity vs. the "fast and loose" Rebol style:</p>
<pre><code>switch/type x [
    block! group! =&gt; [...]
    [even-integer?] [logic?] =&gt; [...]
]
</code></pre>
<p>At one time I suggested that both be offered under different names... call one "choose" and the other "switch".  I dunno.</p>

<p>So how bad, really, is it with my proposal about rethinking TYPE-WORD! (and by extension, TYPE-TUPLE!) to mean "use as type constraint" and swap around what fundamental types use?</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; parse ["abc" [d e f]] [some &amp;series?]
== [d e f]
</code></pre>
<p>Remember, we're used to seeing functions with tics on them, like <strong><code>:series?</code></strong> ... e.g. <em>"I want the value of this function, I don't want you to call it"</em>.  What about the ampersand as a tic meaning "I want you to use this as a type constraint, not a combinator"?</p>
<p>This doesn't preclude someone saying <strong>any-series!: &amp;series?</strong> or <strong>series!!: &amp;series?</strong> or even <strong>series!: &amp;series?</strong> but how important would that ultimately seem to people?  Is this just something we're not used to yet that will feel natural when it comes up?  Isn't it nicer to have a fully generic mechanism to apply to any logic-returning function and be able to pull that out?</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; parse [2 4 6 8] [some &amp;even?]
== 8
</code></pre>
<p>Might something other than an ampersand be less jarring for the TYPE-XXX forms?  There's not really much left, though...:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; parse [2 4 6 8] [some $even?]
== 8
</code></pre>

<p>I should point out that there will still be functions that test for concrete types, like <strong>integer?</strong>.  So people can use those functions in type specs, e.g. <strong>foo: func [x [integer?]] [...]</strong> instead of the type <strong>integer!</strong>.  That's a bit of an annoyance.</p>
