    <title>Killing Off Historical &quot;SKIP&quot; in PARSE</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/killing-off-historical-skip-in-parse/1557</link>
    <description>SKIP suggests you&#39;re not using the result.  Yet historical SKIP doesn&#39;t really do that:

    rebol2&gt; parse [1] [set x skip]
    rebol2&gt; x
    == 1  ; How was this &quot;skipped&quot; exactly?

After contemplation of many possibilities for what this might be (including **`*`**, or **`&lt;*&gt;`**, or **`?`**, or just plain period (**`.`**), I settled on **`&lt;any&gt;`**.

    &gt;&gt; parse [1] [x: &lt;any&gt;]
    &gt;&gt; x
    == 1

I&#39;m quite happy with it--especially in light of removing ANY as a looping combinator from the default combinator set.  It brings ANY to its coherent systemic meaning of ANY-ONE-OF... as opposed to ANY-NUMBER-OF.

But @IngoHohmann suggested that SKIP might be related to ELIDE.  So I tried:

    &gt;&gt; uparse &quot;ab&quot; [&quot;a&quot; skip]
    == &quot;a&quot;

This would make SKIP equivalent to **`ELIDE &lt;any&gt;`**.

## But `SKIP` as `ELIDE &lt;ANY&gt;` IS RARELY USEFUL, AND CONFUSING

If you want `ELIDE &lt;ANY&gt;` just write that.

The general skip takes an argument of how much to skip, and having a PARSE analog to SKIP that takes no argument is just confusing.

**It may be** that SKIP taking an argument is worth having:

    &gt;&gt; uparse &quot;aaab&quot; [skip (3) &quot;b&quot;]
    == &quot;b&quot;

But then we have to decide what SKIP returns:

    &gt;&gt; uparse &quot;aaab&quot; [skip (3)]
    == ???

And you can say that particular case with **`3 &lt;any&gt;`** and it&#39;s shorter.

## Either Way, the Historical Use Is Pointless

So SKIP is not in UPARSE.  Maybe it will have a reinvention some day with a new meaning.</description>

            <p>Seems to me, that skip would be the natural name for your elide.</p>
