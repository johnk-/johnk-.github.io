    <title>Jonathan Blow, and Euclid&#39;s Elements</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/jonathan-blow-and-euclids-elements/1971</link>
    <description>Jonathan Blow is a video game developer--who made a well known indie game called &quot;Braid&quot; that did some fun time/space manipulations people generally hadn&#39;t seen before in a Mario-type platfomer.   Later he took a number of years to make the much higher-budget art piece The Witness...a very intellectual game which has a Sixth-Sense kind of reveal that&#39;s quite good.

Though as time changes him from grumpy indie upstart to grumpy-old-man, he has joined the chorus of us grumpy old men when it comes to complexity:

But I&#39;m pretty sure he would pretty much hate Redbol languages for programming his games.  He doesn&#39;t like scripting, and thinks it&#39;s dumb to use things without static typing or that catch your mistakes in advance.  (And I&#39;m with him when he responds to people who say things like &quot;but you can try changes without restarting&quot; are wrongheaded.  You can compile checked bits of code and reload them dynamically if your system is designed right.)

What he&#39;s looking for is something that offers the benefits of C++ and Rust, but minus the things he considers to be annoying.  &quot;Something like Rust, but cutting out anything that would be an impediment to the games that I--Jonathan Blow--would write.&quot;

I imagine that if Jonathan *were* to appreciate something like Ren-C it would be in the way I do--as a game in itself.  (He actually playtested &quot;Baba is You&quot;--according to a YouTube stream of him playing the final version.  When asked what he was paid to give his feedback he just grumbled &quot;not enough&quot;.  So I probably won&#39;t be sending Ren-C to him.  :-P)

In any case, he was doing a talk on games in education and cited a page from Euclid&#39;s Elements that I thought was interesting.  [The quote he cites says](https://youtu.be/qWFScmtiC44?t=756):

&gt; *&quot;If a first magnitude has to a second the same ratio as a third has to a fourth, and also a fifth has to the second the same ratio as a sixth to a fourth, then the sum of the first and fifth has to the second the same ratio as the sum of the third and sixth has to the fourth.&quot;*

I&#39;m sure it sounded like nonsense to Euclid&#39;s contemporaries, who were not able (or willing) to follow the reasoning for why such things might be important.

When you&#39;re reasoning through new abstract things there&#39;s lots of phases to it.  Terminology and mechanics evolve over time.  That&#39;s how it works, so people shouldn&#39;t be surprised to see things like *[&quot;The Implications of ^META Producing QUASI! from Isotopes&quot;](https://forum.rebol.info/t/the-implications-of-meta-producing-quasi-from-isotopes/1967)*  :-)</description>
