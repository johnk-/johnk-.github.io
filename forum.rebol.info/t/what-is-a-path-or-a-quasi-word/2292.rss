    <title>What is ~/~ : A PATH! or a QUASI-WORD?</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/what-is-a-path-or-a-quasi-word/2292</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve mentioned that there are not going to be quasiform or antiform sequence types.

* We want tildes in paths **`~/home/whatever.txt`**

   * Paths in particular...but they could be useful in tuples (**`~.foo`**) or chains (**`[a]:~`**) 
 
   * Quasiforms might be nice  for some purposes too (**`~null~/a/b/c), (foo:~[a]~`**)

* The known very important usage of tilde in paths, plus all the as-yet-unknown and untapped other uses, far outweigh any advantage I can think of for antiform/quasiform sequences.

So that&#39;s settled.  But there&#39;s a bit of an edge case with the WORD!s like **`/`** or **.** or **:**

And there, I&#39;m going to have to say that **`~/~`** is a quasiword.

* I want all words to have quasiforms (though not antiforms... only system-blessed &quot;keywords&quot; will be allowed to become antiforms).  And so I don&#39;t want to exempt any words from that.

* I don&#39;t think excluding **`~/~`** as a path form has any tremendous consequences

* Allowing it to be a quasiword fits in with **`~///~`** and other such words being quasiwords, and those aren&#39;t valid paths.

So we open up a wider field of parts, keep all words having quasiforms, and lose one weird path representation.

Though it&#39;s not &quot;lost&quot;--if you&#39;re writing dialect code that has some logic for what a PATH! of two tilde-trash would mean, you can specially recognize the quasiword.  You&#39;ll only run into representational trouble if in the same dialect you need a meaning for every possible quasiword that deviates from what the path interpretation would be.

(I&#39;d say I&#39;d bet money that&#39;s never going to happen, except I&#39;ve seen exactly weird things like that happen often enough to know better.  So instead I&#39;ll say &quot;it might happen someday, but I don&#39;t care.&quot;)

Anyway, trying to shore this up a bit, some sample errors:

    &gt;&gt; to path! [~ a]
    == ~/a

    &gt;&gt; to path! [~ ~]
    ** Script Error: Sequence would conflate with WORD! form: ~/~

    &gt;&gt; to path! [a _]
    == a/

    &gt;&gt; to path! [_ _]
    ** Script Error: Sequence would conflate with WORD! form: /

    &gt;&gt; to path! [_ a _]
    == /a/

    &gt;&gt; to path! [a _ b]
    ** Script Error: BLANK! only legal at head and tail of sequence</description>

</aside>
<p>I should mention that dialect-wise, if you're doing quasiform annotations to mean something for variable references <em>(for example)</em>, and you get to the point where you need tuples, then instead of <strong><code>~var~</code></strong> you say <strong><code>~(obj.field)~</code></strong>.</p>
<p>For the sake of simpler processing in your dialect, you might just always mandate the group, e.g. <strong><code>~(var)~</code></strong> .  But that's up to you based on what look you are going for and the other tradeoffs in your dialect.</p>
<h2><a name="p-7756-i-prefer-this-reified-escaping-to-lexical-escaping-1" class="anchor" href="https://forum.rebol.info#p-7756-i-prefer-this-reified-escaping-to-lexical-escaping-1"></a>I prefer this "reified escaping" to "lexical escaping"</h2>
<p>Lexical escaping would be something like this:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; tuple: to tuple! [~ a]
== ~.a

&gt;&gt; quasituple: quasi tuple
== ~\~.a\~  ; or some other arbitrary escaped-rendering method in the system

&gt;&gt; unquasi quasituple
== ~.a
</code></pre>
<p>Rethinking that with reified escaping:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; tuple: to tuple! [~ a]
== ~.a

&gt;&gt; to group! reduce [tuple]  ; a.k.a. ENVELOP/GROUP a.k.a. ENGROUP
== (~.a)

&gt;&gt; quasigroup: quasi engroup tuple
== ~(~.a)~

&gt;&gt; first unquasi quasigroup
== ~.a
</code></pre>
<p>This resembles other places that I've taken this bias.</p>
<p>It represents a shift in my thinking from a decade ago when I advocated for lexical escaping: I thought the system needed to do things like permit words with spaces:</p>
<pre><code>r3-alpha&gt;&gt; word: to word! "word with spaces"
== #[word! "word with spaces"]

r3-alpha&gt;&gt; type? word
== #[datatype! word!]

 r3-alpha&gt;&gt; setword: to set-word! word
 == #[set-word! "word with spaces"]

 r3-alpha&gt;&gt; make object! compose reduce [setword 10]
 == ... oh what a tangled web we weave ...
</code></pre>
<p>With hindsight and a greater vocabulary of containers, I no longer believe this is a good idea.  (Datatypes are another area that have undergone the shift, with <strong><code>word!</code></strong> defined as  <strong><code>&amp;[word]</code></strong> being a TYPE-BLOCK!)</p>
<p>In the grand <a href="http://blog.hostilefork.com/freedom-to-and-freedom-from/">"freedom to vs. freedom from"</a> balance of things, it's better to err on the side of solidity.  The overall systemic <em>Quality-with-a-capital-Q</em> becomes higher by tightening the fundamental bricks...and using reified escaping.</p>
<pre><code> &gt;&gt; type of '[spaced words in block]:
 == &amp;[set-block]  ; ...note: will be &amp;[chain]
</code></pre>
