[...In April 2020...] I was looking at TRANSCODE, which is a fairly complex in terms of its parameterization.  This is the basic routine that exposes the scanner and turns UTF-8 into Rebol values.  *(Cool sidenote: in Ren-C with UTF-8 Everywhere you can now use it on strings, while R3-Alpha could only use it on binaries...)*

A typical TRANSCODE operation turns a string into a block, so conceptually:

     &gt;&gt; transcode &quot;1 [2] &lt;3&gt;&quot;
     == [1 [2] &lt;3&gt;]

     &gt;&gt; transcode &quot;[1 [2] &lt;3&gt;]&quot;
     == [[1 [2] &lt;3&gt;]]   ; always a block of values, even if only one block value

Sometimes people want to transcode just one value at a time, so there is TRANSCODE/NEXT.  As with DO/NEXT, this introduces another useful output... which is where you want to write the advanced position to do further processing.  Let&#39;s look at it in that old style (none of this is real code in Ren-C, so just read it, don&#39;t run it):

     &gt;&gt; transcode/next &quot;1 [2] &lt;3&gt;&quot; &#39;new-pos
     == 1

     &gt;&gt; new-pos
     == &quot;[2] &lt;3&gt;&quot;

There&#39;s yet another potential output variation coming from the /RELAX switch.  This means that if you have gibberish, it will skip that token and return an ERROR! value:

     &gt;&gt; transcode/next/relax &quot;4bad [2] &lt;3&gt;&quot; &#39;new-pos
     == make error! [...whatever...]

     &gt;&gt; new-pos
     == &quot;[2] &lt;3&gt;&quot;

That&#39;s not ideal, as with some kind of ANY-CONTEXT! literal solution you might actually find an ERROR! value in a scan.

### [Then Multi-Returns Were Re-Conceived As Refinement Doppelgangers](https://forum.rebol.info/t/multiple-return-values/1134/6?u=hostilefork)

The way you would do a multi-return is to mark a parameter a &quot;return&quot; parameter, e.g. an output.  The parameter is set either to null, or something to assign--like a refinement--in order to indicate it is requested.  Then at the end of the function when it tears down the frame, those values are set.

So this way if you have a WORD! or PATH! you want to assign, you can pass it in as an argument.  But if you use the multi-return convention, it will implicitly load those slots with variables out of the block on the left.

That means these two situations would appear equivalent to the insides of TRANSCODE:

    &gt;&gt; value: transcode/next/relax &quot;1 [2] &lt;3&gt;&quot; &#39;next-pos &#39;error
    
    &gt;&gt; [value next-pos error]: transcode &quot;1 [2] &lt;3&gt;&quot;

And then, these two would appear equivalent:

    &gt;&gt; value: transcode/relax &quot;1 [2] &lt;3&gt;&quot; &#39;error
    
    &gt;&gt; [value _ error]: transcode &quot;1 [2] &lt;3&gt;&quot;

This means that there needs to be a way of marking arguments as returns in the function spec, and their order matters (just as order of ordinary arguments matters).

It was a great duality, giving you the option to work with named arguments if you want, but provides a shorthand...where SET-BLOCK! collaborates with the evaluator to push into those slots.

**It was quite amazing to see [the benefits to TRANSCODE right off the bat](https://github.com/metaeducation/ren-c/blob/5d70aa4a85dbe3a831653e14b72117e90997fa09/tests/string/transcode.test.reb)!**

## [Then I repeated the success with LOAD...](https://github.com/metaeducation/ren-c/commit/072e932260af3e9bd31fd0092ac80aeedb38139c)

If you want a header you can just say:

    [data header]: load %some-file.reb

And if you don&#39;t want a header, you just say **data: load %some-file.reb** as normal.  This replaces the way the output *changed* in historical Rebol, where LOAD sometimes returned a BLOCK! with a header as the second item, and sometimes it did not.

    rebol2&gt;&gt; load {[Rebol [Title: &quot;hi&quot;] a b c]}
    == [a b c]

    rebol2&gt;&gt; load/header {[Rebol [Title: &quot;hi&quot;] a b c]}
    == [make object! [
            Title: &quot;hi&quot;
            Date: none
            Name: none
            Version: none
            ; ...etc, etc...
            Language: none
            Type: none
            Content: none
        ] a b c
    ]

What&#39;s also an improvement by setting variables directly over the BLOCK! approach is that you don&#39;t have to put BLANK! in a slot, you can really return NULL:

    &gt;&gt; [data header]: load &quot;&lt;no&gt; #header &#39;here&quot;
    == [&lt;no&gt; #header &#39;here]

    &gt;&gt; data
    == [&lt;no&gt; #header &#39;here]

    &gt;&gt; header
    ; null

            <p>Very cool. Thank you— I can see this being really useful for dialects (being coerced out of text, which is relevant for me), and almost anything which helps dialects is a good thing, in my opinion.</p>
