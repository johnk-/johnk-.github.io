    <title>`greb` : Grep Using PARSE?</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/greb-grep-using-parse/1818</link>
    <description>There was a Trello card with a remark from @johnk about an idea from Pekr:

&gt; Not sure how this would work, but it is an interesting excercise to think about.  Something that bridges between unix and rebol syntax like:
&gt;
&gt;     ls | greb &#39;some alpha &quot;.reb&quot;&#39;
&gt;
&gt; (assuming a few more built in rules/charsets)
&gt;
&gt; May need a collect/keep kind of wrapper to retrieve data cleanly.

This would be a very small subset of what @BlackATTR&#39;s QUERY could do...but it seems like it wouldn&#39;t hurt if we went ahead and made this program as a test and put it in the [ren-c-stdio](https://github.com/metaeducation/ren-c-stdio) repository.

I&#39;ve already made things like TAC (backwards unix CAT), where the goal is to see how essential and correct we can make things:

https://github.com/metaeducation/ren-c-stdio/blob/7fc17e5bb36ceeb7f688516ba57db5ad84a923c9/tests/tac.r#L19-L21

**I like the idea of making GREB similarly essential, and part of the samples.**  Worth doing.

(Note that `grep` was itself originally framed as a one-line `awk` program.)

I&#39;ll also throw in a little ping that it would be nice to have a simple web app that exposed PARSE functionality with some highlighting, like [http://regexpal.com/](http://regexpal.com/).  Seems sometimes we get such big ideas in our head we forget to do the small ones (!)</description>
