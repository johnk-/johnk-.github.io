    <title>Dialect Meaning of Non-Words in Function Parameter Spec Blocks</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/dialect-meaning-of-non-words-in-function-parameter-spec-blocks/2064</link>
    <description>Historical Redbol only had WORD!s in the BLOCK! that came after a parameter:

    foo: func [
        arg [block! word! number!]  ;  all words in block
    ] ...

But when Ren-C introduced the paradigm-breaking NULL that could not be put in arrays, that meant there was no `null!` datatype.  To fill the gap, the tag `&lt;opt&gt;` was chosen to indicate the parameter as optional--hence possibly null:

    foo: func [
        arg [&lt;opt&gt; block! word! number!]  ;  now it&#39;s WORD!s and TAG!s
    ] ...

I liked using a TAG! for how it stood out (though in retrospect I&#39;d have probably chosen `&lt;null&gt;`, but everything was named differently then).  Other quirky ideas were floated, like being able to put a leading slash on the typeset block:

    foo: func [
        arg /[block! word! number!]  ; like a refinement, but on the types
    ] ...

That didn&#39;t gain traction, and probably shouldn&#39;t have.

Then when early efforts faced another value state that couldn&#39;t be put in a block and didn&#39;t have a type, **`&lt;void&gt;`** came onto the scene...because as with there being no NULL!, there was no VOID! datatype.

## Tag Modifiers Which Weren&#39;t Type Checkers Showed Up

The ability to take a parameter but get an immutable view of it was added as **`&lt;const&gt;`**.

Parameters that would accept being at the end of input and evaluate to null in that case were **`&lt;end&gt;`**

**`&lt;variadic&gt;`** and **`&lt;skippable&gt;`** came into existence.

These &quot;parameter-control tags&quot; seemed to me to be a distinct category from typecheckers like **`&lt;opt&gt;`** and **`&lt;void&gt;`**.   Having them all use TAG! felt like *too many tags.*

So I mused about splitting the roles, something like:

    [&lt;const&gt; #null type!]
    -or-
    [#const &lt;null&gt; type!]

But I didn&#39;t like the look of it enough to move on it.  So things like **`[&lt;const&gt; &lt;opt&gt; type!]`** stuck around while I wondered about it.

## Today, You Can Specify Any Type Check By Function

There&#39;s still no NULL! or VOID!.  But with the way things work now, you can use functions as &quot;type predicates&quot; to recognize things that aren&#39;t datatypes in their own right:

    foo: func [
        arg [null? block! word! number!]
    ] ...

What&#39;s good:

* It leaves TAG! for the properties like **`&lt;const&gt;`** that don&#39;t have to do with type recognition... but rather controlling the parameter in a more special way.

What&#39;s bad:

* It loses that kind of special look that tags gave to arguments that could take null.  It blurs together, especially with things like SPLICE? and LOGIC? and CHAR? for other non-fundamental datatypes (characters are just single-character issues now, and ~true~ and ~false~ isotopes of WORD! implement logic)

## A Modern Option: ~NULL~ for Taking Null

I made an experiment so if you used a QUASI-WORD!, then it would match an isotope of that form.

It&#39;s a kind of pleasingly distinct look:

    foo: func [
        arg [~null~ block! word! number!]
    ] ...

And it mixes better with the tags:

    foo: func [
        arg [~null~ &lt;const&gt; block! word! number!]
    ] ...

It also works for &quot;nones&quot; (isotopic voids) and doesn&#39;t look too bad there, e.g. for RETURN:

    foo: func [
        return: [~]  ; as opposed to `return: [none?]`
     ] ...

That doesn&#39;t work for voids, and the current idea is that there&#39;s no VOID! because TYPE OF VOID gives back NULL.  This is consistent with void-in-null out in general, although it might confuse people who expect to do:

    switch type of value [
        null [print &quot;This means value was void, not null&quot;]
        ...
    ]

So the idea there was that perhaps TYPE OF NULL is an error, and this guides you to another solution like **switch/type** where you can use **&amp;[null?]** or **&amp;[void?]** as type predicates and get what you actually want.

*(I still don&#39;t think defining **null!: &amp;[null?]** is a good idea, because it looks like a fundamental datatype, and you cannot **make null! ...** etc.  Maybe **null?!: &amp;[null?]** or something like that would be a bit less noisy at usage sites, enough to be worth it?)*

## Allowing NULL? and ~NULL~ As Choices Seems Good

I think we can live with **void?** in function specs for functions that deliberately take voids.  It&#39;s also more legitimate--voids are more neutral than nulls in the current formulation--e.g. **append [a b c] void** is [a b c].

I like the option of **~null~** instead of **null?** to call out the more rare-and-alarming idea of accepting null parameters.

## What about `return: &lt;nihil&gt;` and `return: &lt;none&gt;`

These two special uses of tag! with no block have been used to say you don&#39;t need a RETURN statement at all... the function just gives back none or nihil respectively when the body completes.

How necessary is it?  Well, you either write things like:

    comment: func [
        return: [nihil?]
        discarded [any-value!]
    ][
        return nihil
    ]

Or you have the contraction:

    comment: func [
        return: &lt;nihil&gt;
        discarded [any-value!]
    ][
    ]

This style of &quot;don&#39;t even worry about writing a RETURN&quot; has the widest applicability to NONE and NIHIL.  We don&#39;t strictly need it, but I&#39;ve gotten used to it.

I mention **return: [~]** as a possible alternative for saying none is a return type using the quasiform-means-isotope idea.  And since none falls out of function bodies by default with no return, it&#39;s not strictly necessary to have **`return: &lt;none&gt;`** as any kind of special operation.

Again, how does that look?

    foo: func [
        return: [~]
     ] ...

If you&#39;re going to break the pattern and not say **`return: [none?]`**  then I may call that a break-even alternative to **`return: &lt;none&gt;`**.  A little more symbol-y, but doesn&#39;t break the rhythm of type specs being blocks.

This leaves the nihil case.  We could say **return: [~[]~]** and have that mean &quot;I return an empty pack&quot; but in that case you&#39;d still need an explicit return:

    comment: func [
        return: [~[]~]
        discarded [any-value!]
    ][
        return nihil
    ]

But I think I like **`return: [nihil?]`** better than that.  Compared to **`return: [~]`** the **`[~[]~]`** is a bridge too far.  

Anyway, the reason this is a struggle is that **`return: &lt;none&gt;`** has just become so pervasive that it&#39;s hard to see that changed to **`return: [none?]`**.  But standardizing on blocks and moving away from the tags for this application may be the best idea.</description>
