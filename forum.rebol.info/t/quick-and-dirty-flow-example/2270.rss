    <title>Quick and Dirty FLOW Example</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/quick-and-dirty-flow-example/2270</link>
    <description>At one point I proposed something along the lines of:

    &gt;&gt; flow [
           [1 2 3]
           reverse _
           map-each x _ [x * 10]
       ]
    == [30 20 10]

## Seems Neat.  How Hard Is It To Do?

Well, let&#39;s just be simple-minded to start.

*(and let&#39;s use the up-and-coming notation, just to start getting used to it...as well as my proposed change to [REPLACE to mean REPLACE/ALL by default](https://forum.rebol.info/t/make-replace-all-default-semantics-of-replace/2269/)...)*

    flow: func [
        block [block!]
        :placeholder [element?]
        &lt;local&gt; flow-result
    ][
        placeholder: default [_]
        block: copy block
        replace block placeholder $flow-result
        while [not tail? block] [
             insert block $flow-result:
             [block flow-result]: evaluate:next block
        ]
        return flow-result
    ]

## And On This Example, It Works!

Not with the new notation quite yet, but with the slash-as-refinement notation.  Some notes:

* **element?** means any non-antiform

* **$flow-result** evaluates to the plain word of **flow-result**, but carrying a binding from the current context (in this case, so that the code in the user supplied block can see the local variable in FLOW&#39;s frame)

## But *How* Does It Work?

It simply creates a variable FLOW-RESULT, and then splices it into a copy of the block:

    flow [
        [1 2 3]
        reverse _
        map-each x _ [x * 10]
    ]
    =&gt;
    [
       flow-result: [1 2 3]
       flow-result: reverse flow-result
       flow-result: map-each x flow-result [x * 10]
    ]

But it can&#39;t do it ahead of time, because it doesn&#39;t know the span of the expressions until it executes them.  So it goes one step at a time, inserting the SET-WORD! after each step

    [
       flow-result: [1 2 3]  ; &lt;-- gets to here
       reverse flow-result
       map-each x flow-result [x * 10]
    ]
    ...
    [
       flow-result: [1 2 3]
       flow-result: reverse flow-result  ; &lt;-- gets to here
       map-each x flow-result [x * 10]
    ]
    ...
    [
       flow-result: [1 2 3]
       flow-result: reverse flow-result
       flow-result: map-each x flow-result [x * 10]  ; finished
    ]

## Very Simple, But Useful Right Off The Bat

I don&#39;t know what all design the correct FLOW would need.  It would need to do its replacements deeply (we don&#39;t have REPLACE/DEEP, so you&#39;d have to use PARSE or something).

And I don&#39;t know what features it should have.  But... pretty cool to see this kind of thing be so natural to do.

            <p>Syntax suggestion: I don’t particularly like <code>&lt;$&gt;</code> to denote the hole. I’d suggest <code>_</code> instead (which is what you already suggested for POINTFREE / PARTIAL, so it’s consistent). Naturally, it should be configurable via a refinement.</p>
