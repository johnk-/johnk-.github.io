              <p>Many years ago, I thought about <strong><a href="../hacking-away-on-the-to-and-make-matrix/649.html">trying to untangle of the TO and MAKE matrix</a></strong>.  These operations are notoriously unpredictable in historical Redbol.</p>
<p>I tried putting some stakes in the ground about what I believed <em>had</em> to be true.  It was difficult because I could not think of too many.</p>
<p>One thing I said was that TO should always create a "new" value (if the value was not immediate).  And I felt like this should be true:</p>
<pre><code>to (type of value) value
; ...same as...
copy value
</code></pre>
<p>Grasping for any stake in the ground I could find, I was pretty sure that TO of a string representation of an integer to an integer should give you the integer:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; to integer! "1020"
== 1020  ; we know this, at least? (one hopes...)
</code></pre>
<p>And the reverse, one would think, as well:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; to text! 1020
== "1020"  ; what else *could* it be?  codepoint 1020? -&gt; "ϼ"
</code></pre>
<p>But beyond that it was hard to think of the pattern.</p>
<h2><a name="p-7876-coming-back-to-an-old-idea-reversibility-1" class="anchor" href="2325.html#p-7876-coming-back-to-an-old-idea-reversibility-1"></a>Coming Back To An Old Idea: Reversibility</h2>
<p>When I first encountered Rebol and was made aware of these problems, I suggested TO should be reversible:</p>
<pre><code>value1 = to (type of value1) to type2 value1
</code></pre>
<p>However, this gave what <em>appeared</em> to be very "unexciting" options for behavior:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; to block! 1
== [1]

&gt;&gt; to integer! [1]
== 1

&gt;&gt; to integer! [...anything else in a block that's not integer...]
** Error.  Always.
</code></pre>
<p>That particular idea was was so long ago that I don't have direct quotes on hand of people saying "nah, that sucks, TO could barely do anything."  But I'm pretty sure it was panned by basically everyone I suggested it to.  I guess I agreed, because I dropped it.</p>
<p><strong>Coming back to it now, and seeing it in a new light, I see this as much more useful than I used to.</strong>  Especially when compared to the historical mess that makes TO nigh-unusable.</p>
<p>And in fact, it fits in with several Rebol2/Red behaviors that I'd thought were kind of pointless before:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; to integer! &lt;1&gt;
== 1

&gt;&gt; to tag! 1
== &lt;1&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The use I didn't see at the time was the frequent need when dialecting to push values out of band, into some other type, without losing their meaning.  If you have a dialect in which integers already mean something, but you want a way of pushing some integer-oriented instruction in there...you can use these kinds of operations.</p>
<p>Definitional errors in Ren-C make this convenient, since checking if something fits the pattern is quick, you just throw in a TRY and the antiform error that's the return result of the TO will be suppressed, giving you a "falsey" null:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; thing: &lt;a b&gt;

&gt;&gt; to integer! thing
** Error: Cannot TO convert &lt;a b&gt; to integer

&gt;&gt; try to integer! thing
== ~null~  ; anti
</code></pre>
<p>The more I look at it the more useful it appears.  And it helps give clarity to the MAKE vs. TO division.  If you have something that isn't shaped like this, then <em>maybe</em> MAKE is the right place to put it.  For example:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; to percent! 1
== 1%

&gt;&gt; to integer! 1%
== 1

&gt;&gt; make percent! 1
== 100%
</code></pre>
<p><em>(Note: I think ENCODE + DECODE is a better place for binary conversions, e.g. ENCODE 'IEEE-754 is better than MAKE BINARY! of a decimal because that could mean many things, and ENCODE can have more parameterization for single vs. double precision, etc.  I don't know<br>
if TO BINARY! should work at all, but if it does, I'd probably agree with the Rebol2 choice to give the binary representation of the UTF-8 string... e.g. (to binary! 1020) as #{31303230} ... and use more explicit future-proof routines to encode with specified byte size and endianness.)</em></p>
<h2><a name="p-7876-reversibility-rules-out-rounding-2" class="anchor" href="2325.html#p-7876-reversibility-rules-out-rounding-2"></a>Reversibility Rules Out Rounding</h2>
<p>In order to get losslessness in the representation, you can't throw out information.</p>
<p>So this works:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; to integer! 1.0
== 1

&gt;&gt; to decimal! 1
== 1.0
</code></pre>
<p>But this does not:</p>
<pre><code> &gt;&gt; to integer! 1.5
 ** Error: Can't TO INTEGER! a DECIMAL! w/digits after decimal point
</code></pre>
<p>I don't think that's a problem, because that seems like a job for ROUND.  Unfortunately, R3-Alpha and Red do something dumb:</p>
<pre><code>rebol2&gt;&gt; round 1.5
== 2

red&gt;&gt; round 1.5
== 2.0

r3-alpha&gt;&gt; round 1.5
== 2.0
</code></pre>
<p>It seems this was part of a shift to try and preserve the input type, to facilitate things like rounding MONEY!:</p>
<pre><code>r3-alpha&gt;&gt; round $1.50
== $2
</code></pre>
<p>So I guess the way the thinking went was that if you want to keep MONEY! as MONEY! when you round it, all types should act that way.</p>
<p>I think the relationship between INTEGER! and DECIMAL!, which lack decoration, suggests something more intimate where the type can be lost.  If you don't want to lose it, ROUND:TO 1.0</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; round 1.5
== 2

&gt;&gt; round:to 1.5 1
== 2

&gt;&gt; round:to 1.5 1.0
== 2.0
</code></pre>
<h2><a name="p-7876-blank-pretty-much-has-to-mean-empty-3" class="anchor" href="2325.html#p-7876-blank-pretty-much-has-to-mean-empty-3"></a>BLANK! Pretty Much Has To Mean Empty</h2>
<p>If we're talking about equivalencies, we now know this:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; for-each 'x _ [print "Doesn't run"]
== ~void~  ; anti

&gt;&gt; empty? _
== ~okay~  ; anti
</code></pre>
<p>And so really, it seems that the TO conversion of BLANK! has only one set of answers to fit into the family of reversibility:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; to block! _
== []

&gt;&gt; to text! _
== ""

&gt;&gt; to blank! &lt;&gt;
== _

&gt;&gt; to blank! #{}
== _
</code></pre>
<p>And if you try to TO BLANK! anything that's not conceptually empty, you'd get an error.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; to blank! &lt;a&gt;
** Error: ...
</code></pre>
<p>I don't know if there's a motivating case for saying <strong>to integer! _</strong> should pick something like 0 as an answer, though Rebol2 did something of that sort:</p>
<pre><code>rebol2&gt;&gt; to integer! none
== 0
</code></pre>
<p>Neither Red nor R3-Alpha carried that forward, <a href="https://github.com/metaeducation/rebol-issues/issues/1018">though it was discussed</a></p>
<h2><a name="p-7876-can-be-checked-in-the-implementation-4" class="anchor" href="2325.html#p-7876-can-be-checked-in-the-implementation-4"></a>Can Be Checked In The Implementation</h2>
<p>I've started hacking this through, and it's gone relatively well.  TO dispatches <em><strong>to the type it's converting from</strong></em>, with the type being converted to as the argument.</p>
<p>And it's nice in the sense that the TO native driving the process can also check the reversibility constraint in the debug build, to give it some teeth.</p>
<p><em>(I've rigged up some interesting frame mechanics to enable doing this reversal efficiently, that have sped up other parts of the system (like CASCADE) with "downlevel shifting", that can bypass a trampoline bounce...)</em></p>
<p>Anyway, things are a mess right now with a couple hundred broken tests to painfully sift through.  But I think the reversibility rule is good... biggest questions are whether that relaxes in terms of spacing...</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; to block! "  1    2  "
== [1 2]  ; legal?
</code></pre>
<p>This would suggest you would have to compare with the trimmed/canonized version of your input.</p>
<p>Also, issues of string representations.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; b: to block! "--{1}--"
== ["1"]  ; legal?
</code></pre>
<p>So there are some pain points, but chipping away at them.</p>

            <div class='post' itemprop='text'>
              <p>So as a first cut of getting family of equivalencies and reversibility, I wound up with something like this:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; to path! [a.b c.d]
== a.b/c.d  ; what we have "assumed" from history

&gt;&gt; to block! 'a.b/c.d
== [a.b c.d]  ; add in reversibility requirement

&gt;&gt; to text! [a.b c.d]
== "a.b c.d"

&gt;&gt; to path! "a.b c.d"
== a.b/c.d  ; being consistent within the equivalencies
</code></pre>
<p>This was making it a given that TO PATH! of a BLOCK! of items would item-wise join the things into a path.</p>
<p>When you turn the crank with the other rules about reversible transformations and equivalencies, that's just what you get.</p>
<p>BUT if all string classes act equivalently, then it breaks a behavior that was relied upon pretty heavily:</p>
<pre><code> &gt;&gt; to file! 'foo/baz.bar
 == %"foo baz.bar"  ; historical code was expecting %foo/baz.bar

<p>It's a pretty uphill argument to say that's good.</p>
<h3><a name="p-7893-in-order-to-maintain-the-equivalencies-i-am-promoting-and-fix-this-i-think-we-have-to-push-away-from-the-idea-that-to-is-the-tool-you-reach-for-to-make-sequences-from-blocks-1" class="anchor" href="2325.html#p-7893-in-order-to-maintain-the-equivalencies-i-am-promoting-and-fix-this-i-think-we-have-to-push-away-from-the-idea-that-to-is-the-tool-you-reach-for-to-make-sequences-from-blocks-1"></a>In order to maintain the equivalencies I am promoting, and fix this, I think we have to push away from the idea that TO is the tool you reach for to make sequences from blocks.</h3>
<p>It forces our hand to:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; to block! 'a.b/c.d
== [a.b/c.d]

&gt;&gt; to path! [a.b/c.d]
== a.b/c.d
</code></pre>
<p>But as I've tried to explain, these are useful things--more than was realized.</p>
<p>And all is not lost...and arguably improved...because we have JOIN.  Right now I'm suggesting it would come in two varieties... reducing and non-reducing, based on whether you use a <strong><code>[...]</code></strong> or <strong><code>@[...]</code></strong></p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; join path! ['a.b 'c.d]
== a.b/c.d

&gt;&gt; join path! @[a.b c.d]
== a.b/c.d

&gt;&gt; block: [a.b c.d]

&gt;&gt; inert block
== @[a.b c.d]

&gt;&gt; join path! inert block
== a.b/c.d
</code></pre>
<p>So there's some flexibility there.</p>

<p>Honestly, isn't JOIN clearer than TO, in terms of telling you what's going on?</p>
