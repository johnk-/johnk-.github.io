          <p>As the /ONLY debacle was chipped away at... slowly... the role of quoting came to the forefront.  Quotes were used to <em>suppress</em> splicing (in contrast with today's isotopic blocks through SPREAD, which <em>request</em> the splicing).</p>
<p>So the anti-spread behavior looked something like:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; append [a b c] first [[d e]]
== [a b c d e]

&gt;&gt; append [a b c] first ['[d e]]
== [a b c [d e]]
</code></pre>
<p>I'm picking out of an outer block there just to avoid confusion, because notice what happens when there's no container:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; append [a b c] [d e]
== [a b c d e]

&gt;&gt; append [a b c] '[d e]
== [a b c d e]
</code></pre>
<p>By design, the evaluator strips off quotes, leading to potential confusion when it comes to what people might think they could do with such a system.</p>
<p>You might think that this is all fine and you could just call the function QUOTE instead of putting a quote mark on the value.  Hence the quoted block is an evaluation <em>product</em> not an evaluation <em>input</em>...and so it makes it to the append:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; append [a b c] [d e]
== [a b c d e]

&gt;&gt; append [a b c] quote [d e]
== [a b c [d e]]
</code></pre>
<p>But there were protections that were added to try and discern if you were adding non-inert values without quoting them.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; append [a b c] "this was presumed okay since it was inert"
== [a b c "this was presumed okay since it was inert"]

&gt;&gt; append [a b c] 'd
** Error: d is a WORD! and evaluative...your callsite might accidentally lose an
    apostrophe if you didn't know what you were doing.  Quote it to be safe.
</code></pre>
<p><em>(Note: I always disliked how these errors were working, I just hadn't gotten to the isotope design yet.  They did afford some protection.)</em></p>
<p>This would lead you to a couple of bad options to work with the case when you had something evalutative at source level:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; append [a b c] quote 'd
== [a b c d]

&gt;&gt; append [a b c] ''d
== [a b c d]
</code></pre>
<p>In an attempt to make the "just add a thing at source level" case a slight bit easier, I made JUST.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; just d
== 'd

&gt;&gt; append [a b c] just d
== [a b c d]
</code></pre>
<h3>Let's Take A Moment To Be Thankful For Isotopes...</h3>
<p>All of this is behind us now.</p>
<p><img src="https://forum.rebol.info/images/emoji/twitter/pray.png?v=9" title=":pray:" class="emoji only-emoji" alt=":pray:"></p>
<p>But of course, the mechanics are actually nearly identical.  Just subtract 1 from all the quoting levels, and allow -1 for BLOCK!s.  <em>(Then build upon years of diligence in bulletproofing the system from leaking -1 quotelevels where they shouldn't be.)</em></p>
<h2>But JUST is Free Again.  Now What?</h2>
<p>There was a time when JUST was what I now call THE.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; just x
== x

&gt;&gt; just ''[foo]
== ''[foo]
</code></pre>
<p>I thought it was a good word for it at the time.  But THE won me over:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; the x
== x

&gt;&gt; the ''[foo]
== ''[foo]
</code></pre>
<h3>Maybe Something That Limits to One Expression Only?</h3>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; just add 1 2
== 3

&gt;&gt; just add 1 2 10
** FAIL: JUST code had residual material: 10
</code></pre>
<p>I've been wanting a syntax for this at the API level, when you think you're running one expression:</p>
<pre><code>REBVAL* sum = rebJust("add", value1, value2, "10");
</code></pre>
<p>In that world, it's not any more typing (actually less typing than rebValue)...but gives you an extra bit of safety.</p>
<p>With regular (non-API) code, I can see it being very useful in generated code scenarios.</p>
<h3>Perhaps A THE-like Operator With A Shade of Meaning In PARSE?</h3>
<p>PARSE needs to keep raw material sometimes, and I've pointed out some of the hazards in the past of making you do this with GROUP!s when nested compositions are involved.</p>
<p>So might these be different?  As an example:</p>
<pre><code>parse ... [x: the ''foo] =&gt; parse ... [x: (the ''foo)]

parse ... [x: just ''foo] =&gt; parse ... [x: '''foo]
</code></pre>
<p>So above, THE is synthesizing ''foo out of whole cloth with no need to match it in the input.  The other would require a ''foo in the input to be considered a match.</p>
<p>For WORD!s, the above sense of JUST isn't as necessary, as there's a decent visual trick:</p>
<pre><code>parse ... [x: just ''foo] =&gt; parse ... [x: '|''foo|]
</code></pre>
<p>But other datatypes would not have this out, and you'd always be reading the thing you see in the rule as having one more quote level than what you're matching.</p>
<p>There's the option of putting it in an @ group:</p>
<pre><code>parse ... [x: just ''foo] =&gt; parse ... [x: @(the ''foo)]
</code></pre>
<p>But this has the problems I mention about nested composition that can be a major hassle when writing rule genreators and you have to weasel something like <strong><code>''foo</code></strong> inside a group inside a composed block.</p>
<p>This definition might jibe with keeping the regular evaluator meaning of JUST as it is (literal but add a quoting level).</p>
<h3>Other Ideas?</h3>
<p>Hopefully no one wants to fight to swap JUST with THE, because I really like THE as it is.</p>
