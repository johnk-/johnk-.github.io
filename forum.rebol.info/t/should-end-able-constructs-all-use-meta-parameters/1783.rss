    <title>Should END-able constructs all use ^META parameters?</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/should-end-able-constructs-all-use-meta-parameters/1783</link>
    <description>R3-Alpha and Rebol2 could only have functions that were &quot;endable&quot; if the argument they took was quoted.  This feature was added primarily for HELP, so that you could say either:

    &gt;&gt; help
    ; (would display generic HELP usage information)

    &gt;&gt; help topic
    ; (would display help for the given topic)
    
It was a *very limited form of variadic-ness*...generally used only in console-oriented commands (HELP, LS).  You couldn&#39;t write a function that was evaluative, like:

    redbol&gt;&gt; printer 1 + 2
    3

    redbol&gt;&gt; printer
    You called the PRINTER function with no arguments
        ; ^-- not possible to accomplish with an otherwise evaluative argument!

Being able to handle getting to the end of input was entwined with taking quoted arguments.

## Ren-C added `&lt;end&gt;`-able Evaluative Parameters

To facilitate certain demos in Ren Garden, Ren-C could mark an ordinary parameter as being `&lt;end&gt;`-able.  This would mean that the argument would show up as being NULL if the end was reached before an argument was seen.

This was--however--ambiguous with if you actually passed an evaluative NULL.

    ren-c&gt;&gt; printer 1 + 2
    3

    ren-c&gt;&gt; printer
    You called the PRINTER function with no arguments

    ren-c&gt;&gt; printer null  
    You called the PRINTER function with no arguments  ; d&#39;oh

**This kind of ambiguity wasn&#39;t new...the Redbol version had it.**  The signal for quoted parameters that were endable-and-missing was to make the parameter an UNSET!.  Which meant they couldn&#39;t tell the difference between **help #[unset!]** and just-plain-help:

    red&gt;&gt; help #[unset!]
    To use HELP, supply a word or value as its
    argument:

        help insert
        help system
        help system/script

    To view all words that...

**Interestingly enough, Ren-C has a solution for this with quoted parameters, because NULL cannot appear literally in source...so it can&#39;t be at the callsite.  Thus NULL can represent a missing quoted argument.**  Which is neat.

## ^META parameters can do `&lt;end&gt;` another way...

A meta parameter is quoted, but will be a quoted void if the callsite was passing a void:

So if our PRINTER took a ^META argument:

    &gt;&gt; printer 1 + 2
    3
    ; (it actually received &#39;3, quoted)

    &gt;&gt; printer &#39;
    You called the PRINTER function with no arguments
    ; (it actually received &#39;)

The ambiguity is still there, though...

    &gt;&gt; printer void
    You called the PRINTER function with no arguments
    ; (again, it actually received &#39;)

**But at least you could differentiate NULL from an end.**  The conflation of an invisible argument with the end doesn&#39;t seem as troubling to me, as the problem with HELP is fixed since it quotes and can tell when you say **help void** vs. plain **help**

## Killing off `&lt;end&gt;` as a core parameter flag would simplify things...

* If a quoted parameter tolerates NULL as one of its legal types that&#39;s sufficient to say it is &quot;endable&quot;

* If an evaluative parameter needs to detect endability, it could be your job to make it a ^META parameter and look for void, and unquote it to handle other results.

The code and typeset flags for `&lt;end&gt;` could then be scrapped.

If someone really liked the NULL conflating version of endability they could write something to do it in usermode.

**You&#39;d have to see the code to understand why I would think throwing away **`&lt;end&gt;`** is worth it.** The way the type checking is done frames have to be filled first, which means if a function doesn&#39;t want an actual null but wants just ends to reflect as null... or wants an actual null but doesn&#39;t want ends reflected as null... hidden bits need to be grafted onto these nulls at the time of frame fulfillment to say whether it&#39;s an &quot;endish&quot; null or a regular null.  Various parts of the system then need to test a NULL for this invisible property.  **^META parameters pull such invisible state into the light.**

**Basically take my word for it: meta is much cleaner, and offers a way to expose these distinctions to the user--so I think the odds are that `&lt;end&gt;` and its current mechanics need to die.**</description>

</aside>
<p>This was the right spirit, but <a href="https://forum.rebol.info/t/match-in-rust-vs-switch/1835/5">given some further thought</a> I am proposing to go ahead and reserve the isotopic word of <strong>~end~</strong> for this purpose (and in general, go ahead and probably reserve all isotopic words for system use)</p>
<p><strong>If your argument is endable and not ^META, it will be something like this.</strong></p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; foo
Congratulations, you got an ~end~ isotope

&gt;&gt; foo ~end~
** Error: ~end~ is not a legitimate callsite argument

&gt;&gt; f: make frame! :foo
== make frame! [value: ~]

&gt;&gt; f.value: ~end~
&gt;&gt; do f
Congratulations, you got an ~end~ isotope
</code></pre>
<p><strong>If your argument is ^META and not endable, you can get this</strong></p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; bar
** Error: bar.value is not endable

&gt;&gt; bar ~end~
Congratulations, you got an ~end~ quasiform

&gt;&gt; f: make frame! :bar
== make frame! [value: ~]

&gt;&gt; f.value: ~end~
&gt;&gt; do f
** Error: bar.value is not endable

&gt;&gt; f: make frame! :bar
== make frame! [value: ~]

&gt;&gt; f.value: '~end~
&gt;&gt; do f
Congratulations, you got an ~end~ quasiform
</code></pre>
<p><strong>And if you have an endable ^META parameter, it meshes both possibilities together:</strong></p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; baz
Congratulations, you got an ~end~ isotope

&gt;&gt; baz ~end~
Congratulations, you got an ~end~ quasiform

&gt;&gt; f: make frame! :baz
== make frame! [value: ~]

&gt;&gt; f.value: ~end~
&gt;&gt; do f
Congratulations, you got an ~end~ isotope

&gt;&gt; f: make frame! :baz
== make frame! [value: ~]

&gt;&gt; f.value: '~end~
&gt;&gt; do f
Congratulations, you got an ~end~ quasiform
</code></pre>
<p>...under these rules <em>there is no conflation</em>...</p>
<p><strong>Functions only receive ~end~ isotopes on <code>&lt;end&gt;</code>-able parameters, but those isotopes can come from deliberate assignment in frames as well as an end encountered at the callsite.</strong></p>

</aside>
<p><strong>...but now...there is a solution!</strong></p>
<p>I've mentioned how we're now at a point where when you ^META things you always get something that's either QUOTED! or QUASI!, <a href="https://forum.rebol.info/t/the-meta-of-null-and-void/1941">because the edges of VOID and NULL are now spoken for</a></p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; meta null
== '

&gt;&gt; meta void
== ~
</code></pre>
<p>That leaves a ton of representations open for what an <code>&lt;end&gt;</code> could be... but of course the best one jumps out at us right away... NULL !</p>
<p><strong>NULL is now a viable ^META answer for "I couldn't even get you that meta argument you wanted"!</strong>  And it has just the right amount of orneryness.  Easy to check for, and you won't likely be passing it on to places</p>
<p>With that issue solved, we can come back to the original question:</p>

<p>I have reasons beyond the scope of this post, but:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I think you should be able to make any parameter endable</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's probably best if NULL is used to represent that across the board.</p>

</aside>
<p>Trying to do this creates an unappealing situation, because it means all ^META parameters start accepting end conditions by default.  <img src="https://forum.rebol.info/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=12" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
<p>That's a bit of an overreach.  Just because you say you want an argument to be passed via meta protocol, having to handle the ~void~ case of there being nothing there becomes a hassle.  Labeling things <code>&lt;end&gt;</code> is much more convenient, otherwise you will end up with a lot of accidental tolerance of ends...producing particularly troublemaking invisibility signals.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I think we can say that if you care about the difference between an end and an evaluated NULL then we now have an answer: an endable ^META parameter which receives ~void~ can only get that if at an end.  With what I observed about <strong>^(...)</strong> I think we can say there are no "supermeta" parameters... so the only way you will get a ~void~ indication will be if the evaulation reaches an END (or a comma).</p>
<p>So "endish nulls" are dying, which should get rid of bugs like this:</p>
