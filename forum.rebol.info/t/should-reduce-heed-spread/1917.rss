    <title>Should REDUCE Heed SPREAD?</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/should-reduce-heed-spread/1917</link>
    <description>When [suggesting the term SPREAD](https://forum.rebol.info/t/putting-splicing-intent-on-appended-value/1873/9?u=hostilefork), @rgchris gave this example for REDUCE behavior, which hadn&#39;t occurred to me previously:

    &gt;&gt; reduce [spread [a b c] [a b c]]
    == [a b c [a b c]]

Nothing about the design makes this happen automatically.  REDUCE has historically errored on isotopes.  So code has to be added to override that.

I&#39;m guessing most people would be in favor of having the splicing behavior.  Arguments that say that there should be a 1:1 correspondence between expressions and values in a REDUCE are already pretty much out the window, since VOID elements vanish (including conditionals that don&#39;t take any branch).
      
## DELIMIT Would Presumably Want It Too

I&#39;ve complained in the past that the often random-seeming treatments of blocks in Rebol2 functions like REJOIN lead to problems--and that it would be better if people had to be explicit about their intent.  This offers the ability to &quot;inherit&quot; whatever the enclosing delimiting strategy is, and fold into the existing operation (technically more efficient):

    &gt;&gt; block: [&quot;c&quot; &quot;d&quot;]

    &gt;&gt; spaced [&quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot; block]
    ** Error: BLOCK! not handled by DELIMIT, use SPREAD or desired string conversion

    &gt;&gt; spaced [&quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot; spread block]
    == &quot;a b c d&quot;

    &gt;&gt; spaced [&quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot; unspaced block]  ; if you wanted another interpretation
    == &quot;a b cd&quot;

I believe I prefer this over having some default way that blocks behave inside string conversions.  The odds of guessing right are low enough that it&#39;s better to have people be explicit.

So...presuming there&#39;s no objections....there&#39;s an agenda item to fuse together the stackless logic that performs a REDUCE so that it&#39;s the same code running in DELIMIT, so I&#39;d probably go ahead and do that and make these things work.

**UPDATE circa Oct 2022: This has been done, so you can now use this feature.**</description>

<p>It's reasonable to ask if it works that way.  But it does not.  <img src="https://forum.rebol.info/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>The quoting level of a BLOCK! (or any other value) lives in its cell, not in the series pointed to that contains the contents.  It's a property like whether a slot in a block has the NEW-LINE flag.</p>
<p>Remember that the same underlying array storage can be imaged multiple times:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; block: [a b]

&gt;&gt; four: reduce [block, quote block, quote quote block, quasi block]
== [[a b] '[a b] ''[a b] ~[a b]~]

&gt;&gt; append block 'c

&gt;&gt; four
== [[a b c] '[a b c] ''[a b c] ~[a b c]~]
</code></pre>
<p>The quoting (and/or quasi) level lives resident in the bits of FOUR's array holding the cells.  The cells point at the array storage for BLOCK.</p>
<p>The only way to change the quoting levels is to manipulate the actual contents of FOUR.  You can't do it by modifying the BLOCK variable to change its quote level--that's only relevant to the cell stored in the context where block's value is looked up:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; block: spread block
== ~(a b c)~  ; isotope

&gt;&gt; four
== [[a b c] '[a b c] ''[a b c] ~[a b c]~]  ; unchanged
</code></pre>
<p>Hence there's no means to subversively create the situation of an isotope inside a block remotely.  You have to go through a function like CHANGE.  They can spread the values, or error, or have some other reaction--but they'll never be allowed to put the isotope in the block.</p>

        <title>Should REDUCE Heed SPREAD?</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[rgchris]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>A small thought for now:</p>
<pre><code>a: 'a b: 'b c: 'c
; for infinite reduction of 'a 'b and 'c

block: [a b c [a b c]]

reduce block
=&gt; [a b c [a b c]]
; ok

find block spread pick block 4
=&gt; [a b c [a b c]]
; ok

spread pick block 4
=&gt; isotope value
; ok, or 'isotoped value' or 'isotopic value' or just 'isotope'?

reduce block
=&gt; [a b c a b c]
; ??
</code></pre>
<p>Does SPREAD here apply the isotope to that value in place or does it create something new? I kind of suspect the latter, but is it reasonable to expect the above behaviour?</p>
