    <title>What to call the anti-DEFAULT?</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/what-to-call-the-anti-default/475</link>
    <description>DEFAULT exists to run a block of code to give something a value if it doesn&#39;t have one already.

     &gt;&gt; x: ~
     &gt;&gt; x: default [10 + 20]
     &gt;&gt; print x
     30

     &gt;&gt; x: &lt;some-tag&gt;
     &gt;&gt; x: default [10 + 20]
     &gt;&gt; print x
     &lt;some-tag&gt;

@gchiu at one time asked for an *&quot;anti-default&quot;*.  Rather than make the decision of whether to overwrite or not based on the content of the variable and only sometimes evaluate the block...*always* evaluate the block, then decide whether to overwrite or not based on the result of that evaluation.

The name suggested for it was **UPDATE**:

    &gt;&gt; x: &lt;some-tag&gt;
    &gt;&gt; x: update if false [&lt;unused-tag&gt;]
    &gt;&gt; print x
    &lt;some-tag&gt;

     &gt;&gt; x: &lt;some-tag&gt;
     &gt;&gt; x: update if true [10 + 20]
     &gt;&gt; print x
     30

This seems very useful to me.  While simple conditionals can move assignments into the block of code, e.g. `x: if c [v]` =&gt; `if c [x: v]`, more complex instances might have several points they&#39;d have to selectively do the same assignment:

    number-of-variants: update case [
        whatever1 [do some stuff, 1020]  ; update for this case
        whatever2 [do some stuff, void]  ; don&#39;t update in this case
        whatever3 [do some stuff, 304]  ; update for this case 
    ]  ; don&#39;t update if no matches

But what we noticed was that UPDATE has been taken for a somewhat esoteric port action that I don&#39;t think anyone is using at the moment.

  http://www.rebol.com/docs/words/wupdate.html

I&#39;m not totally getting it, as it seems sort of like a WAIT statement, a SYNC, a FLUSH, a FETCH... I dunno.  UPDATE seems a strange word to grab when there&#39;s this nice other function for it.

It&#39;s in use... but the only mentions are internal.  It&#39;s what native port actors use to [&quot;respond to WAKE-UP&quot;](https://github.com/metaeducation/ren-c/blob/master/src/core/n-io.c#L448).  The name could be bumped to ON-WAKE-UP.</description>

            <p>I found a 2020 thread where I just repeated this idea...again.  In that post I called it PERHAPS.  Which I like a bit better as a part of speech than MIGHT.</p>

</aside>
<p>Eeeeh.  No.  Seeing the <strong><code>x: (...)</code></strong> looks too much like the assignment is a done deal before MIGHT (or whatever) has a chance to say anything about it.</p>
<p>I should point out that now things like CASE and SWITCH return NULL again, so PERHAPS would either have to consider both VOID and NULL as non-updating states... or you'd have to put MAYBE on nulls.</p>
<pre><code>x: perhaps case [...]

<p>Yes MIGHT is a good candidate.<br>
Introduce it and if a better option comes along it can always be replaced by that.</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="https://forum.rebol.info/u/gchiu">@gchiu</a> suggests MIGHT</p>
<p>I think I like it.  Though one thought is that <strong>x: might (...)</strong> has the problem of it sounding a bit like the thing that might happen or not is the code in the block running, vs the assignment that might happen.</p>
<p><em>(Writing <strong>might x: (...)</strong> may make it look a bit more like it's the assignment which might happen, at the cost of making it look like it might assign the block literally.  :-/)</em></p>
<p>Anyway, MIGHT is my favorite so far.</p>

            <p>UPDATE also is used for database manipulation.<br>
TLUAFED as anti DEFAULT.<br>
Or some other creative option, INGEST, TAKE-IN, TRY-ASSIGN<br>
I like WHATEVER too.</p>

            <p>I'm suggesting <code>something</code> for the anti-default though</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; help something
something is a WORD! bound to a context, but has no value.

<p>for the reason that <a href="https://philosophy.stackexchange.com/questions/8173/can-something-come-out-of-nothing-or-not-why" rel="nofollow noopener">something can not come out of nothing</a></p>
