    <title>ARRAY/INITIAL and ACTION! Isotopes</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/array-initial-and-action-isotopes/1975</link>
    <description>So the ARRAY mezzanine from R3-Alpha allowed you to make an array with an initial value that could be a function...in which case it evaluated that function each time:

    r3-alpha&gt;&gt; array 3
    == [none none none]

    r3-alpha&gt;&gt; array/initial 3 10
    == [10 10 10]

    r3-alpha&gt;&gt; n: 0 array/initial 3 does [n: n + 1]
    == [1 2 3]

This raises the question of how you would make an array whose initial value was itself a function.

If you&#39;re a loophole-minded person, you might notice you could trick *this particular case* by making a function that returns a function.

    r3-alpha&gt;&gt; array/initial 3 does [:append]
    == [#[action! [...]] #[action! [...]] #[action! [...]]]

But that&#39;s not really a general answer for how to deal with this kind of polymorphism--it just works if you&#39;re using the result purely to do a substitution.

## Trying This With Isotopic ACTION!s

I&#39;ve loosened my stance on isotopes in function frames as parameters.  It&#39;s not a good idea to take them as default, but forcing you to make every parameter ^META just to get isotopes is limiting.

So I gave this a shot.  The notation I&#39;ve got for now is that something like `[~action!~]` in a typeset says that parameter is willing to accept action isotopes.

    array: func [
        {Makes and initializes a block of a given size}

        return: &quot;Generated block or null if blank input&quot;
            [block!]
        size &quot;Size or block of sizes for each dimension&quot;
            [&lt;maybe&gt; integer! block!]
        /initial &quot;Initial value (will be called each time if action isotope)&quot;
            [any-value! ~action!~]
    ]

So that **[any-value! ~action!~]** leads to a willingness to accept function isotopes.  Having such an annotation leads you into the &quot;danger zone&quot; where if you don&#39;t prefix accesses to INITIAL with a colon, you run the risk of running a function.  But if you don&#39;t have the annotation, you don&#39;t have to be paranoid and decorate your references.

Here&#39;s how the INITIAL references wind up in the implementation:

    case [
        block? rest [
            repeat size [append block (array/initial rest :initial)]
        ]
        activation? :initial [
            repeat size [append block run :initial]  ; Called every time
        ]
        any-series? initial [
            repeat size [append block (copy/deep initial)]
        ]
    ] else [
        append/dup block initial size
    ]

So the BLOCK! case which recurses uses the :INITIAL for pass-thru.

I used **RUN :INITIAL** when I could have just used **INITIAL**, simply because it feels more clear.  If this wasn&#39;t already contained by being at the end of a block, it would be better to limit the parameterization by saying something like **`apply :initial []`** or the now-equivalent **`initial/ []`**

Since the only isotope type in the typecheck is action, there&#39;s no need to use the leading colon for the other references.

## And It Works

What we&#39;re kind of accepting as a default is that function generation produces isotopes.  So getting a plain action requires some kind of extra step, like REIFY

    &gt;&gt; func [x] []
    == ~#[action! [x]]~  ; isotope

    &gt;&gt; action: reify func [x] []
    == #[action! {action} [x]]

    &gt;&gt; action  ; not word!-active
    == #[action! {action} [x]]
    
    &gt;&gt; ap: reify :append
    == #[action! {ap} [series value /part /dup /line]]

    &gt;&gt; ap
    == #[action! {ap} [series value /part /dup /line]]

What this means is that you get a similar behavior to before, where if you pass a &quot;live&quot; function you&#39;ve fetched from a word or just generated, then it runs.  You have to do something extra to it to get it to be inert.

    &gt;&gt; array 3
    == [_ _ _]

    &gt;&gt; array/initial 3 10
    == [10 10 10]

    &gt;&gt; n: 0 array/initial 3 does [n: n + 1]
    == [1 2 3]

    &gt;&gt; array/initial 3 reify does [n: n + 1]
    == [#[action! []] #[action! []] #[action! []]]

## That Looks Like A Polymorphism Success Story...

It doesn&#39;t require any convoluted thinking to get the literal vs. non-literal distinction.  And you can apply this technique to cases that don&#39;t have a weird workaround.

**And of course what I really like here is how you have to explicitly indicate you tolerate function parameters that will execute if you don&#39;t use a GET-WORD! access.**

I wish I could say that all of ACTION! isotopes impacts were as well sorted out as this looks.  But it&#39;s a start, and it shows the potential.</description>
