    <title>Shim Code for Modal Arguments</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/shim-code-for-modal-arguments/1185</link>
    <description>&gt; **UPDATE**: *MODAL PARAMETERS ARE NOW DEAD!* ...as far as the core is concerned.  It was troubling code that contaminated the model, and it will be troubling no longer.
&gt;
&gt; The [elegant solution of isotopic blocks](https://forum.rebol.info/t/a-justification-of-generalized-isotopes/1918) is now solving what they were trying to do.
&gt;
&gt; Regardless, modal parameters were based on an interesting idea: to use literal pattern recognition at the callsite to control turning refinements on and off.

---

**Modal Parameters** are an idea to mark an argument conveniently as controlling a refinement--without mentioning that refinement at the callsite, or needing a specialization of the function dispatched through a different name.

Perhaps it&#39;s easiest to see by example:

     demo: function [@a /mode-a @b /mode-b] [
         print [&quot;a:&quot; mold a]
         print [&quot;mode-a:&quot; mold mode-a else [&quot;; null&quot;]]
         print [&quot;b:&quot; mold b]
         print [&quot;mode-b:&quot; mold mode-b else [&quot;; null&quot;]]
     ]

Using literal (non-quoted) @-arguments will automatically turn on the associated mode refinement.  The argument itself will be the appropriate value for the non-@ version of the argument.  (WORD! and PATH! will fetch, GROUP! will evaluate, BLOCK! will be unevaluated).

     &gt;&gt; demo 1 + 2 10 + 20
     a: 3
     mode-a: ; null
     b: 30
     mode-b: ; null

     &gt;&gt; demo @(1 + 2) 10 + 20
     a: 3
     mode-a: #
     b: 30
     mode-b: ; null

     &gt;&gt; foo: &quot;foo&quot; | demo @[x y z] @foo
     a: [x y z]
     mode-a: #
     b: &quot;foo&quot;
     mode-b: #
   
     &gt;&gt; foo: [10 @bar] | demo &#39;@[x y z] second foo
     a: @[x y z]
     mode-a: ; null
     b: @bar 
     mode-b: ; null

The refinements are available to invoke independently as normal.  This means that from a specialization or APPLY standpoint the parameter convention would be as-is.

## Proof-Of-Concept Implementation In Usermode

Here&#39;s a sample of how APPEND might splice blocks by default, but suppress with @.

It was designed to operate on top of the Redbol APPEND/ONLY model where splices are default.

    append: function [
        series
        &#39;nosplice [&lt;skip&gt; the-word! the-path! the-block! the-group!]
        value [&lt;...&gt; any-value!]
        /only
    ][
        switch type of nosplice [
            null [redbol.append series take value] ; no @... act variadic
            the-block! [redbol.append/only series as block! splicer]
            the-group! [redbol.append/only series do as group! splicer]
            the-word! [redbol.append/only series get splicer]
            the-path! [redbol.append/only series get splicer]
       ]
    ]

## Consequences

This leaves splicing the default:

    &gt;&gt; append [a b c] [d e]
    == [a b c d e]

But if you use an @... at the callsite it offers alternate ways of requesting /ONLY:

    &gt;&gt; append [a b c] @[d e]
    == [a b c [d e]]

The trickery though is that it *has to be a literal @*... at the callsite.  Indirectly that doesn&#39;t apply (if it comes from a reference or expression), it will append in the typical fashion, whatever that would be:

    &gt;&gt; item: @[d e]
    == @[d e]

    &gt;&gt; append [a b c] item
    == [a b c d e]  ; or should only plain BLOCK! splice?

The callsite permits conventional expressions for the plain case (now an /ONLY behavior), written out as a full evaluation (e.g. the argument is not quoted):

    &gt;&gt; append [a b c] reverse copy [d e]
    == [a b c e d]

On the other hand, the /only cases are all going through a quoted argument...but these provide variations besides an @-block:

    &gt;&gt; append [a b c] @item
    == [a b c [d e]]

    &gt;&gt; append [a b c] @(reverse copy item)
    == [a b c [e d]]

And again, these variations are visible at the callsite; they don&#39;t accidentally sneak in to run code as /ONLY if your callsite didn&#39;t make it look that way just due to some indirect value:

    &gt;&gt; item: @(reverse copy item)
    == @(reverse copy item)

    &gt;&gt; append [a b c] item
    == [a b c reverse copy item]  ; ANY-ARRAY! splice?

If you really do want to deliberately append an @... then you can do so with quoting (which you&#39;d have to do for a WORD! or other evaluative type that you didn&#39;t mean &quot;do something evaluatory with&quot;)</description>

    (did fooy: :foo/y)

    ([a x] = parameters of :fooy)

]

; Invisibility sensitivity
;
; Modal parameters use the unevaluated flag to inform callers that an
; argument "dissolved", so they can differentiate @(comment "hi") and @(null)
; The mechanism used is much like how &lt;end&gt; and &lt;opt&gt; are distinguished.
[
    (sensor: func [@arg [&lt;opt&gt; &lt;end&gt; any-value!] /modal] [

    ([_ # #[true]] = sensor @())
    ([_ # #[true]] = sensor @(comment "hi"))

    ; ([_ # #[true]] = sensor @nihil)  ; !!! maybe this should work?
