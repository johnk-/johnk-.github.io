    <title>Why Isn&#39;t PRINT Invisible?</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/why-isnt-print-invisible/1824</link>
    <description>&gt; Note: This pertinent question moved from a topic culled by curation.
&gt; 
&gt; *(The topic was &quot;should you be able to assign ~unset~ isotopes via SET-WORD! without getting an error, and the answer is obviously yes in light of new features...so the old conversation was just a jumble of outdated terminology which would confuse anyone finding it.)*

On a tangential note: I&#39;m not sure why PRINT returns a ~none~ isotope, and wonder if it wouldn&#39;t be better to have it be silent like ELIDE? Would that create havoc if new users did confuse its usage?</description>

<p>The usefulness of the return result is that it isn't always a ~none~ isotope, but NULL if nothing--not even a newline--was printed.  This lets you use it with the likes of ELSE.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; label: null
&gt;&gt; message: null

&gt;&gt; block: compose [((label)) ((message))]
== []  ; if you print this it outputs nothing--not even a newline

&gt;&gt; print block else [
       print "Here you can handle that there was no output."
   ]

&gt;&gt; if didn't print block [
       print "DID and DIDN'T are pure NULL-reactive if you don't like THEN/ELSE"
   ]
</code></pre>
<p><em>(Note: Performance dictates that returning the aggregated printed string itself is probably wasteful, since it is used so infrequently.)</em></p>
<p>Being able to <strong>elide print [...]</strong> covers the case where you want an invisible usage somewhere in the middle of an evaluation, which is nice and general...and not so strange once you get used to using it.</p>
