    <title>Why Isn&#39;t PRINT Invisible?</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/why-isnt-print-invisible/1824</link>
    <description>&gt; Note: This pertinent question moved from a topic culled by curation.
&gt; 
&gt; *(The topic was &quot;should you be able to assign ~unset~ isotopes via SET-WORD! without getting an error, and the answer is obviously yes in light of new features...so the old conversation was just a jumble of outdated terminology which would confuse anyone finding it.)*

On a tangential note: I&#39;m not sure why PRINT returns a ~none~ isotope, and wonder if it wouldn&#39;t be better to have it be silent like ELIDE? Would that create havoc if new users did confuse its usage?</description>
