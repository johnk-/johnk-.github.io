    <title>Generic Quoting Makes Headway on MAKE OBJECT!</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/generic-quoting-makes-headway-on-make-object/997</link>
    <description>Rebol2/R3-Alpha/Red have a notation for molding out objects:

    Red&gt;&gt; obj: make object! [a: 10]
    == make object! [
        a: 10
    ]

Let&#39;s ignore for the moment the fact that it&#39;s giving a sequence of what looks to be two words and a block to denote a single OBJECT!.  What it&#39;s trying to do is give you a syntax that looks like what it would take to create the object if typed from source.   (Perhaps it would more appropriately be SOURCE OBJ vs. MOLD OBJ)

## Little Objects with Big Problems

First, remember that Red&#39;s QUOTE is Ren-C&#39;s THE (give next item literally).

Now what if you said:

    Red&gt;&gt; obj: make object! [g: quote (1 + 2) u: 0 unset &#39;u w: quote &#39;word n: none]
    == make object! [
        g: (1 + 2)
        u: unset
        w: &#39;word
        n: none
    ]

The resulting MOLDing MAKE OBJECT! doesn&#39;t get close to what it&#39;s trying to capture.

* In the original object G is a &quot;PAREN!&quot; with (1 + 2).  Running that MAKE OBJECT! would give you G of INTEGER 3.

* We&#39;ll assume it meant #[unset] instead of the word UNSET

   * To run as written, it would confusingly pass the UNSET function the next line as an argument.  It would do `unset w: &#39;word`, thus unsetting word

    * If it had said `u: #[unset]` instead, the make object! would have failed, as it&#39;s not legal to assign unsets via set-word in historical Rebol or Red.

* W would come out as a WORD! here, instead of the LIT-WORD! in the original object.

* N here might seem to work, but it only works so long as the word NONE is bound to #[none].  So round-tripping this field depends on the context you run the make object in.

## Generalized escaping to the rescue

Ren-C doesn&#39;t have a full solution to the problem of round-trip representations as text.  But now, when it comes to this, it&#39;s at least a powerful step closer.

    &gt;&gt; obj: make object! [g: the (1 + 2) u: ~ w: the &#39;word n: null]
    == make object! [
        g: &#39;(1 + 2)
        u: ~
        w: &#39;&#39;word
        n: ~null~
    ]

Here we see these loopholes getting closed.  The make is actually able to produce a structurally identical object *(like I said, let&#39;s avoid talking about binding, that&#39;s its own conversation)*.

And reconstructing the object is context-independent...no keywords are being used.  Note that I threw in a NULL for good measure, to show that there&#39;s a representation for that... a quasiform of the word &quot;null&quot;...that evaluates to the antiform of the word null.

The **`n: ~`** is another quasiform... the quasiform of blank (&quot;trash&quot;), which evaluates to the antiform of blank, which represents the state of an unset variable ([called &quot;NOTHING&quot;](https://forum.rebol.info/t/why-nothing-is-the-name-for-unset-state/2078)).  Assignment of nothing to variables is legal so it wouldn&#39;t generate an error to run that *(there is a state called NIHIL which is an empty pack isotope, which can&#39;t be assigned, but it&#39;s not legal to store in variables ever so no need to represent it here...though you could)*.

It&#39;s not necessary to put the apostrophe on all items, only those that evaluate...so the system should probably only add them if needed:

    &gt;&gt; obj: make object! [i: 10 t: &quot;hello&quot; p: &#39;&#39;a/b/c]
    == make object! [
        i: 10
        t: &quot;hello&quot;
        p: &#39;&#39;a/b/c
    ]

INTEGER! and TEXT! can be left as-is, so perhaps worth it to do so.  Here we see a &quot;LIT-PATH!&quot; (actually a quoted PATH!), escaped in the original representation for its assignment, escaped again for its re-representation.

**This generalized-escaping-based mechanism replaces a previous attempt to deal with the issue, and gives strong evidence that the effort was time well spent.**  :face_with_monocle:</description>

<p>Speaking a <em>little</em> about binding...</p>
<p>...given how <a href="https://forum.rebol.info/t/rebol-and-scopes-well-why-not/1751">pure virtual binding</a> is evolving, we are now considering BLOCK! to be "evaluative" because it will pick up bindings from the local environment... while quoted things will not.  <em>(The previous iteration of pure virtual binding had all values--including quoted ones--getting binding, because binding propagation was done in all structural operations... including PICK and FOR-EACH... leading to a mire of multiply-applied binding that is now being reined in with the consequence of living in a mostly-unbound world.)</em></p>
<p>To be consistent here, we'll need anywhere a BLOCK is being represented "by value under evaluation" to quote it:</p>
<pre><code> &gt;&gt; block: '[foo]

 &gt;&gt; foo: &lt;bar&gt;

 &gt;&gt; obj: make object! [b: block]
 == make object! [
     b: '[foo]
 ]
</code></pre>
<p>Use your imagination that we're actually in a rich terminal where that block "argument" to the MAKE OBJECT! is a rendering of something that you could get the address of and execute.  If you did, you would want that quote on the [foo] block to indicate that it should not pick up a binding.</p>
<p>Thanks to doing string interpolation <a href="https://forum.rebol.info/t/could-strings-have-context/587/27">by putting strings in blocks</a> vs. giving strings bindings, this won't be needed for strings.</p>

<p>Oldes says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"To be honest, I'm not sure if it's correct in Red. I think Red's behavior is inconsistent.<br>
I believe that these 3 results should not be same:"</p>
<pre><code>red&gt;&gt; body-of make object! [a: 1 + 1 c: to lit-word! 'a]
== [
   a: 2 
   c: 'a
]

red&gt;&gt; body-of make object! [a: 1 + 1 c: 'a]
== [
    a: 2 
    c: 'a
]

red&gt;&gt; body-of make object! [a: 1 + 1 c: to word! 'a]
== [
    a: 2 
    c: 'a
]
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>They then try to discuss it, but of course they've rejected the techniques that can resolve it (generic quoting and isotopes).</p>
<p>I'll again point out that there are still fundamental issues with representing bound structures via a text-based round trip that should not be ignored.  But, for the basic considerations here are fairly well covered.</p>
<p>There's simply a lot of solutions here bearing fruit, while their understanding has not moved an inch since Rebol2.  <img src="https://forum.rebol.info/images/emoji/twitter/man_shrugging.png?v=12" title=":man_shrugging:" class="emoji" alt=":man_shrugging:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
