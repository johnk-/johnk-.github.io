    <title>Parameter Order in Rebol</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/parameter-order-in-rebol/1238</link>
    <description>With the advent of [Point-Free expression](https://forum.rebol.info/t/looking-into-a-usermode-pointfree/1236), things that were wordy using SPECIALIZE are now succinct.  You don&#39;t have to name the parameters...which saves typing and also keeps you from having to look it up:

    next: specialize &#39;skip [offset: 1]
    ;
    ; ...becomes
    ;
    next: (&lt;- skip _ 1)

Though that placeholder is a little bit unsatisfying.  Which means one starts looking at questions like &quot;in Rebol, why isn&#39;t the offset to skip by *first*&quot;.  In the narrow case of this specialization, it would make it a bit briefer and seem more natural...

    next: (&lt;- skip 1)

And to play devil&#39;s advocate, if Rebol is to be English-inspired instead of traditional OOP inspired...wouldn&#39;t you say:

    &quot;Skip 10 pages ahead&quot;

Instead of the more awkward:

    &quot;Skip pages ahead by 10&quot;

It&#39;s almost like the underscore in the partial specialization is playing the role of `&quot;by&quot;`.  But, anyway--is there some kind of universal rule to guide such decisions?

## Most-or-Least Important Thing First

Since this looks very Haskell-y, here&#39;s a good summary paragraph [from a StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/31738041/211160) on why Haskell users would favor `(&lt;- skip 1)` to `(&lt;- skip _ 1)`:

&gt; *&quot;It&#39;s common practice in Haskell to order function parameters so that parameters which &quot;configure&quot; an operation come first, and the &quot;main thing being operated on&quot; comes last. This is often counter intuitive coming from other languages, since it tends to mean you end up passing the &quot;least important&quot; information first. It&#39;s especially jarring coming from OO where the &quot;main&quot; argument is usually the object on which the method is being invoked, occurring so early in in the call that it&#39;s out of the parameter list entirely!&quot;*

One thing about the least important parameter is it is often briefer to express.  Consider the example we hit with DELIMIT when the data to act on was first:

    delimit [
        &quot;here&quot; &quot;is&quot; &quot;my&quot;
        long block of code stuff
        &quot;and we go on for a while&quot;
    ] &quot;,&quot;

By the time you get to the comma, you might have forgotten what you are doing.  It seems it&#39;s pretty rare for the thing you&#39;re delimiting with to be coming from a long and complex expression, while the thing you&#39;re operating on may well be a giant expression (like a COLLECT).

So @johnk and I thought it seemed better to say:

    delimit &quot;,&quot; [
        &quot;here&quot; &quot;is&quot; &quot;my&quot;
        long block of code stuff
        &quot;and we go on for a while&quot;
    ]

So that was changed...and as a consequence we get natural-looking specializations now like:
 
    spaced: (&lt;- delimit space)

What does this mean for old-school institutions like SKIP?  I don&#39;t know.  **But I do know it&#39;s getting faster and clearer to bend the system to anything you want it to be...**</description>

<p>If you were to look at it with fresh eyes, as someone who had never programmed before (but spoke English), how different would you perceive these orderings of parameters to some array mutation operations... would one seem preferable over the other?</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; append 'd [a b c]
== [a b c d]

&gt;&gt; append [a b c] 'd
== [a b c d]

&gt;&gt; insert 'a [b c d]
== [a b c d]

&gt;&gt; insert [b c d] 'a
== [a b c d]
</code></pre>

<h2><a name="p-7956-claudeai-says-2" class="anchor" href="https://forum.rebol.info#p-7956-claudeai-says-2"></a>Claude.AI Says...</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Let me analyze these parameter orderings from a fresh, beginner's perspective.</p>
<p>The first thing I notice is there's a subtle but important pattern in these operations. If we look at the append and insert examples, there are two variations:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>append 'd [a b c]</code> and <code>insert 'a [b c d]</code></li>
<li><code>append [a b c] 'd</code> and <code>insert [b c d] 'a</code></li>
</ol>
<p>From a newcomer's perspective, I'd argue that the first set (1) feels more intuitive and readable. Here's why:</p>
<ul>
<li>The target collection (the array/list) comes <em>after</em> the element being added</li>
<li>This reads more like natural language: "append 'd to [a b c]"</li>
<li>It feels like you're specifying "what" first (the element), then "where" second (the collection)</li>
</ul>
<p>The alternative ordering (2) requires a bit more mental gymnastics. When you say <code>append [a b c] 'd</code>, you're essentially saying "append this whole list to this single item", which feels counterintuitive.</p>
<p>The same logic applies to the <code>insert</code> operations. <code>insert 'a [b c d]</code> reads more naturally as "insert 'a into [b c d]" compared to <code>insert [b c d] 'a</code>.</p>
<p>So if I were completely new to programming, I would find the first set of orderings (<code>append 'd [a b c]</code> and <code>insert 'a [b c d]</code>) more:</p>
<ul>
<li>Readable</li>
<li>Predictable</li>
<li>Aligned with how I might describe the operation in spoken language</li>
</ul>
<p>This suggests the design prioritizes clarity and cognitive ease for the programmer, which is crucial when learning a new programming language or concept.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>I'm wondering if we didn't have our preconceptions, would it be obviously the case that the reverse order was more natural...or not?  <img src="https://forum.rebol.info/images/emoji/twitter/face_with_diagonal_mouth.png?v=12" title=":face_with_diagonal_mouth:" class="emoji" alt=":face_with_diagonal_mouth:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
<p>It is true that it takes some gymnastics to write it out:</p>
<pre><code>append [a b c] 'd
=&gt;
append to [a b c] the value 'd

vs.

append 'd [a b c]
=&gt;
append 'd to [a b c]
</code></pre>
<p>But along with that, this idea of the "lesser important" (configuring) parameters being first, is something that's really gotten into my head...the reverse-OOP argument from Haskell.  I've made it possible now for generics to dispatch on any parameter, so it's technically not an issue any longer to choose a different dispatch.</p>

            <p>I think it has been mentioned somewhere before:</p>
<p>If refinements are their own parameters, couldn't parameters also be their own refinements?</p>
<p>This would mean, you could change the order of parameters at the callsite.</p>
<p>It feels a little weird, that you would have to add a parameter as refinement to the call, to move it to the end.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; f: func [a b][print spaced [a b]]

‌&gt;&gt; f 1 2
1 2

‌&gt;&gt; f/a 1 2
2 1</code></pre>
