    <title>TRY PARSE + PARSE EXCEPT : *FAIL* On Mismatch</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/try-parse-parse-except-fail-on-mismatch/1924</link>
    <description>There&#39;s a snazzy new potential for giving more informative messages / logs from failed parses... which means we now have a more interesting option than we might have had before.

Imagine something like:

    &gt;&gt; parse &quot;aaa&quot; [some &quot;a&quot; some &quot;b&quot;]
    ** Error: SOME requires at least one match
    ** Where: [some &quot;a&quot; \\ some &quot;b&quot; \\]
    ; Note: this failure can be intercepted by TRY, EXCEPT, ATTEMPT

It can&#39;t be perfect unless it maintains some kind of large error tree that accumulates the list of all the reasons it decided to fail, so you might have to be in a debugging mode to ask it to give you a bigger diagnostic.  But we can build it now with the participation of the combinators themselves.

**But not only this, we could open up the full spectrum of return values.**  Right now if your parse returns NULL, it has to be contorted into a null isotope to avoid accidentally cuing an ELSE.  Similar contortions for void, blank, and logic false.

    result: parse block rules except e -&gt; [print &quot;Got an error&quot;, return]

    ; If you got here, you know result is good
    ; Even if it was a purposefully returned NULL, etc.

There&#39;d be some way to rig this up without using enfix.  I might make things more lax about letting you assign error isotopes, because the isotope will bubble through and cause a problem anyway.  So you could write something like:

     if fail? result: parse block rules [
         print &quot;You have a failure, use ^result to get it&quot;
     ]

If you were willing to collapse failure down to a NULL or somesuch, or didn&#39;t even care about the result, you could just TRY it.

     try parse block rules

## Too Good Not To Be The Default

Of course you&#39;ll be able to reskin it however you like for the R3C&#39;s or R3Chius out there.  But I think this looks like a perfect convergence to put in the box.

Errors aren&#39;t going to be that interesting on day one, but it&#39;s good to point the ship in the right direction.</description>
