    <title>Dialecting Function Calls: New, Weird, Powerful</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/dialecting-function-calls-new-weird-powerful/2310</link>
    <description>The advent of the [CHAIN! datatype](https://forum.rebol.info/t/introducingnew-chain-datatype/2226) has provoked the idea of *dialecting function calls themselves*.

I&#39;ve given examples like pointing the variable to blame for a failure...because you often don&#39;t really want an error message to implicate the location where the error itself is raised, but rather some callsite arbitrarily far up the stack.

The proposal I had for this was to change:

    fail:blame [&quot;This failure will implicate VAR at callsite&quot;] $var

Into:

    fail:$var [&quot;This failure will implicate VAR at callsite&quot;]

Another idea I mentioned was the concept of folding the function you want to use as a predicate into the chain.  At first I suggested allowing these names to conflate with what looked like a refinement:

    &gt;&gt; any:even? [1 3 8 7 10]
    == 8

The rationalizing I used was to say &quot;Well, in dialects we have cases where if a keyword isn&#39;t recognized then it falls back to looking up the word.&quot;   That&#39;s how PARSE works... like in this historical case:

    red&gt;&gt; begin: &quot;[&quot; end: &quot;]&quot;
    == &quot;]&quot;

    red&gt;&gt; parse &quot;[aaa]&quot; [begin copy stuff to end skip]
    == false

Er, so maybe I should say &quot;that&#39;s how PARSE doesn&#39;t work&quot;.  In any case, the END keyword overrode the END variable definition.  But BEGIN matched, because there&#39;s no parse keyword for BEGIN.

*(Note: This is a reason why Ren-C uses **`&lt;end&gt;`** the tag combinator instead of END the word combinator...and other tag combinators for noun-like things.)*

So maybe it&#39;s not the best plan to follow the lead there.  Another idea would be to use a TYPE-WORD!

    &gt;&gt; any:&amp;even? [1 3 8 7 10]
    == 8

It&#39;s a little clunkier, but it&#39;s clearer what&#39;s going on.  In this case, the predicate is a single arity function which returns NULL or OKAY...and that&#39;s what ANY wants, so it&#39;s a particularly good match.

That also works for my suggestion of **`quote:&amp;word?`** and **`meta:&amp;raised?`**.  Though it implies that if you composed them together you&#39;d have to say **`quote:&amp;quote:&amp;word?`**, and it doesn&#39;t look as good as **`quote:quote:word?`**

Also...in this case the predicate is a single arity function that returns a logic.  But other cases aren&#39;t, and wouldn&#39;t make sense to use `&amp;`.  What about them?

## Is Conflation Stupid, Or Outside-The-Box Genius?

I can&#39;t really tell if allowing you to write the likes of **`any:even?`** and proceeding blissfully along outweighs the missing &quot;conscious marker&quot; of why EVEN? wouldn&#39;t be any refinement you can find on the HELP for ANY.

Part of me thinks &quot;that&#39;s the way this game is played&quot;.  Another part of me is thinking about how the system wouldn&#39;t know what to do with this.  How would the system know how to specialize that, and put EVEN? into the :PREDICATE slot?  Would **`any:even?/`** just throw up its hands and error?  For that matter, does **`any:&amp;even?/`** really get any easier?

**I guess that aspect of &quot;it doesn&#39;t get any easier either way&quot; suggests we have room to experiment and see how it feels.**

Actions would have to have some kind of &quot;Interpret Chain&quot; hook that would go from CHAIN! =&gt; FRAME!.  Because this is likely to be performance sensitive, the system should offer some kind of parameterization of the default hook (e.g. &quot;if you don&#39;t recognize anything from the spec, fetch it and throw it into parameter named XXX&quot; or &quot;if you see something with a certain sigil, fetch it and throw it into a parameter named YYY&quot;)

I guess I&#39;d like to try living in the **`any:even?`** and **`meta:raised?`** universe a bit and get a bit more informed before making the stupid vs. genius verdict.</description>
