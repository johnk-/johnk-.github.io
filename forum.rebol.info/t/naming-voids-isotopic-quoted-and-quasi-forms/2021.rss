    <title>Naming void&#39;s isotopic, quoted, and quasi forms</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/naming-voids-isotopic-quoted-and-quasi-forms/2021</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve called the state of unset variables &quot;nihil&quot;... **this is the isotopic state of void**.  I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the best name but I definitely know I don&#39;t like calling it &quot;unset&quot; (I always say &quot;variables are unset, not values&quot;).

The meta state of void is just a single apostrophe.  Evaluating it produces void:

    &gt;&gt; &#39;
    ; void

The quasi state of void is a single tilde, and it evaluates to nihil:

    &gt;&gt; ~
    == ~  ; isotope  &lt;-- a.k.a. nihil

I mentioned that I prefer this to be the default for making an ARRAY if you don&#39;t specify an /INITIAL value because it is the reified stand-in for uninitialized-ness.  Unlike blanks, it would error if you try to SPREAD it:

    &gt;&gt; block: array 10
    == [~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~]

    &gt;&gt; spread block.2
    ** Error...

This seems to me a better default than blank for any slots that you miss filling in for your arrays.

**So what do we call `[&#39;]` and `[~]`**?  Metavoid and Quasivoid?  Tick and tilde?  Is tilde a Metanihil?

I&#39;ve also wondered if there&#39;s any better name for nihil.</description>
