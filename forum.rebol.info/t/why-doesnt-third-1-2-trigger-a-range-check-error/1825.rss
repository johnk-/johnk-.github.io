    <title>Why Doesn&#39;t `(third [1 2])` Trigger A Range Check Error?</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/why-doesnt-third-1-2-trigger-a-range-check-error/1825</link>
    <description>Quick question for clarity. I assume that

    compose [ 1 (1 / 0) 3 ]
would be a math error. Why is

    compose [ 1 (third [ 1 2 ]) 3 ]
not some kind of a range check error?</description>

<p>Systemically, we consider NULL to be a "soft" form of failure.  It serves a signaling role that's a little like what NONE! tried to do in historical Rebol, but since it's not an ANY-VALUE! more functions treat it as an error:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; third [1 2]
; null

&gt;&gt; append [a b c] third [1 2]
** Script Error: append requires value argument to not be null
</code></pre>
<p>The theory is that places which require an ANY-VALUE! will error down the line, and that having a lot of constructs that make it easier to react to the "soft failure" is a better tradeoff.<br>
There are a lot of options for handling it:</p>
<pre><code> ; x will be blank if either the third element was a blank or if there was
 ; no third element.  Branch won't run if third element is falsey.
 ;
 if x: try third [1 2] [...branch does not run...]
 if x: try third [1 2 #[false]] [....branch does not run...]

 ; x will be null if there was no third element, and branch would run even
 ; if there was a falsey element in the third slot.
 ;
 if did x: third [1 2] [...branch does not run....]
 if did x: third [1 2 #[false]] [...branch runs...]
 x: third [1 2] then [...branch does not run...]
 x: third [1 2 #[false]] then [...branch runs...]
</code></pre>
<p>Experience has borne out that soft failure is a more convenient for functions like THIRD than raising an error.  If anyone finds a case where they don't think so, I'd be interested to see it.</p>
