    <title>Why Isn&#39;t PRINT Invisible (&quot;void&quot;)?</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/why-isnt-print-invisible-void/1466</link>
    <description>Since PRINT doesn&#39;t have an interesting return value, we might ask what the harm would be in making it invisible.

But let&#39;s generalize the question to SOME-FUNCTION where the key point is that at the time you write it, you haven&#39;t thought of a meaningful result for it.

## Catching Erroneous Assignments

Returning an &quot;ornery&quot; value helps catch mistakes more easily when a meaningless result is accidentally used.

But with invisibles, we might adopt a philosophy like C&#39;s, and say you cannot put a void function directly after an assignment:

    int x = some_void_function(...);  /* compiler will error */

Interestingly, C lets use them in comma-delimited expressions so long as they are discarded...you have to use parentheses to do it:

    int x = (some_void_function(...), 10 + 20);  /* this is okay */
    int x =  some_void_function(...), 10 + 20;  /* this errors */

We could do something similar

    x: comment &quot;hi&quot; 1 + 2  ; this could error
    x: (comment &quot;hi&quot; 1 + 2)  ; this could be okay

That&#39;s a little bit of a bummer for comment, but not the end of the world.

However, I want to see Ren-C&#39;s void/invisible used for things like BREAKPOINT and other tools... where having to rearrange your code in this way could be a nuisance (or dialect-wise, the GROUP!s could have semantic implications, e.g. if the code was inside of a COMPOSE).

But there are other issues...

## Limiting Interface Flexibility

If at the time of writing a function you know that it doesn&#39;t have a meaningful return value, then making it void--instead of returning a trash value--ties your hands in changing it.

People will start writing things like:

    all [
        ...
        some-function ...  ; user assumes no effect, because invisible
        ...
    ]

But if SOME-FUNCTION had returned a trash value, then they could have gotten the same effect more obviously with:

    all [
        ...
        elide some-function ...
        ...
    ]

This also gives more freedom to change the interface later, if you think of an interesting value to return.  You can progressively add more return types after the fact.  But once people assume you always return void, this trap will happen...you&#39;re locked in forever in a way that was pretty much completely avoidable.

## In PRINT&#39;s Case, a Differentiated NULL Output Has Value

Having a return value from PRINT that is either an ornery value or nothing lets you offer the neat option of returning NULL if the result of the print was nothing.

     &gt;&gt; line: &quot;some text&quot;
     &gt;&gt; print line then [print &quot;We had output!&quot;]
     some text
     We had output!

     &gt;&gt; line: _
     &gt;&gt; print line then [print &quot;We had output!&quot;]  ; no-op

To do this kind of thing requires having an output value.

I might be convinced that how people want to use PRINT is universally enough that they would rather it be invisible.  But that would involve a very specific understanding of a very common function...similar to how **elide** and **comment** and **assert** and **--** are known to have no result.

I don&#39;t think the average &quot;no meaningful result&quot; function fits in this category, and I&#39;d say I&#39;m fairly skeptical if PRINT belongs in it.

## I Think &quot;Void&quot; Functions Should Be Used Sparingly

I think the feature should be *discoverable*, because how it&#39;s done is unique...and we are giving it a more normal name (&quot;void function&quot;)

I&#39;m feeling a bit more amenable to the idea that these are void return modes, even if it creates barriers to a multi-valued RETURN:

    f1: func [x] [return]
    f1: func [x] [return comment x]

But this means there needs to be a relatively comfortable syntax for returning a BAD-WORD! that is like what we&#39;re used to.  [I&#39;m wondering if **return none**, recycling the word none for **~none~**, is the right compromise.](https://forum.rebol.info/t/the-return-of-none/1467)

&gt; **UPDATE:** I&#39;ve found some other reasons why not to do this again.  So I think arity-0 RETURN is likely going to keep the &quot;return meaningless (and ornery) value&quot; semantic.</description>

<p>On a tangential note: I'm not sure why PRINT returns a ~none~ isotope, and wonder if it wouldn't be better to have it be silent like ELIDE?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>This is worth revisiting, since <a href="https://forum.rebol.info/t/pure-vs-impure-invisibility-do-we-need-both/1782/3">mechanics have changed significantly with voids</a></p>
<p>Today's voids can be observed via a ^META operation, but do not exist otherwise.</p>
<p>Let's pretend PRINT was <strong><code>return: &lt;void&gt;</code></strong> for a second:</p>
<pre><code> &gt;&gt; print "voids are currently shown by the console (good info!)"
 ; void (decays to none)

 &gt;&gt; 1 + 2 print "but they vanish in non-meta contexts"
 == 3

 &gt;&gt; 1 + 2 ^ print "one meta level up, you get @void"
 == @void
</code></pre>
<p><em>(If you're wondering why the ^META of true void is <strong><code>@void</code></strong> and not the plain BAD-WORD! <strong><code>~void~</code></strong>, it's because void isotopes have another role to play.  They are used as markers in FRAME! for when a frame that has been fulfilled--but not type-checked yet--had a void parameter.  But this means void isotopes have their own legitimate "realness" and can't be conflated with true void, hence the distinct ^META state)</em></p>
<p>Since things like ELSE take their left hand side as ^META parameters, that means they can see even the true voids, and act on them appropriately.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; item1: null, item2: null

&gt;&gt; print [try item1 try item2] else [print "No output!"]
No output!

&gt;&gt; item1: "Something!", item2: null

&gt;&gt; print [try item2 try item2] else [print "No output!"]
Something
</code></pre>
<p>Since void isotopes have no reified form, they decay to "none" on assignment (the <strong><code>~</code></strong> isotope, what you might have thought of as an #[unset] before).</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; x: print "so you have the safety"

&gt;&gt; y: print "no console output means none, as before with #[unset]"
</code></pre>
<h2>Sounds Good... So Why Not Make PRINT Void, Then?</h2>
<p>One thing about voids is that you get feedback about them in the console that you don't get with the "none" value:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; print "if this makes void, the console tells you"
; void (decays to none)
</code></pre>
<p>That's kind of annoying.  So we must ask the question: <strong>Why doesn't the console pick the void state--the one that has no reifying value at all--as the true emptiness that it does not print?</strong></p>
<p>That sounds nice in theory.  But in practice, you wind up with this kind of thing:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; 1 + 2 print "Hi"
Hi
== 3
</code></pre>
<p>You might think you could invent something that erases that product, maybe it's what a vertical bar would do:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; 1 + 2 | print "Hi"
Hi
</code></pre>
<p>But... how would you write it?  It either returns something (which makes it print out that thing) or it returns void (and has no effect, letting the previous evaluation seep through).</p>
<p><strong>This is kind of the proof case for why the signal to the console to not display a result has to be "a thing".</strong>  If it's not a thing, then the intent can't be expressed persistently.</p>
<p>Now that "none" is simply <strong>~</strong>, we have a slightly greater justification on why it doesn't print...there's less data in it.  It's the ghostly (but reified) isotope that unset variables hold.</p>

</aside>
<p>The usefulness of the return result is that it isn't always a ~none~ isotope, but NULL if nothing--not even a newline--was printed.  This lets you use it with the likes of ELSE.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; label: null
&gt;&gt; message: null

&gt;&gt; block: compose [((label)) ((message))]
== []  ; if you print this it outputs nothing--not even a newline

&gt;&gt; print block else [
       print "Here you can handle that there was no output."
   ]

&gt;&gt; if didn't print block [
       print "DID and DIDN'T are pure NULL-reactive if you don't like THEN/ELSE"
   ]
</code></pre>
<p><em>(Note: Performance dictates that returning the aggregated printed string itself is probably wasteful, since it is used so infrequently.)</em></p>
<p>Being able to <strong>elide print [...]</strong> covers the case where you want an invisible usage somewhere in the middle of an evaluation, which is nice and general...and not so strange once you get used to using it.</p>
