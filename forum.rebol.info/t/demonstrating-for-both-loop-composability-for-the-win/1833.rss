    <title>Demonstrating FOR-BOTH: Loop Composability For The Win :exclamation:</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/demonstrating-for-both-loop-composability-for-the-win/1833</link>
    <description>FOR-BOTH was an early talking point for an extremely simple usermode loop construct that would be built out of two FOR-EACH loops:

     &gt;&gt; for-both x [1 2] [3 4] [print [x], x = 5]
     1
     2
     3
     4
     == #[false]

A naive implementation of this in Rebol2 might look like:

     for-both-naive: func [&#39;var blk1 blk2 body] [
         foreach :var blk1 body
         foreach :var blk2 body
     ]

...but...

* **It will not honor BREAK correctly**

      &gt;&gt; for-both-naive x [1 2] [3 4] [if x = 2 [break], print [x], x = 5]
      1
      3  ; the BREAK only broke the first FOREACH
      4
      == #[none]

    There&#39;s no way from the outside of Rebol2 or Red&#39;s FOREACH to know for sure that a BREAK was requested.  BREAK returns NONE!, but a loop body can (and often does) evaluate to NONE! as well.  Red made it even worse by adding BREAK/RETURN--so a breaking loop can return *anything*.

     So you&#39;d need some kind of complex binding to search the loop bodies and bind the BREAK word to something that throws and gets caught...even for this simple goal.

* **The loop won&#39;t evaluate to the last result of the body**.  

      &gt;&gt; for-both-naive x [1 2] [] [print [x], x * 10]
      1  ; evaluated to 10
      2  ; evaluated to 20
      == #[none!]

    If the second series is empty, the fallout from the first loop is forgotten.

## Behold Ren-C&#39;s Elegant Solution to FOR-BOTH

*Underneath its apparent simplicity lies quite a lot of deep thought.*  And the mechanisms it uses apply far beyond just loops!

        for-both: func [&#39;var blk1 blk2 body] [
            return unmeta all [
                meta for-each (var) blk1 body
                meta for-each (var) blk2 body
            ]
        ]

*(Note: see followup for why RETURN is necessary with FUNC, and how to avoid it with LAMBDA.)*

### It solves the BREAK case

Below we see a situation where the first FOR-EACH returns NULL (and **meta null** is just **null**).  So it short-circuits the ALL, and propagates the null as a signal that it broke:

    &gt;&gt; for-both x [1 2] [3 4] [if x = &#39;2 [break], print [x], x = 5]
    1
    ; null

Note that the first pass through the loop did not terminate the ALL, just because the body evaluated to false.  That&#39;s because meta of ordinary values produces QUOTED!, which is truthy even if the quoted thing is falsey.

     &gt;&gt; metafalse: meta #[false]
     == &#39;#[false]

     &gt;&gt; type of metafalse
     == #[datatype! quoted!]

    &gt;&gt; if metafalse [print &quot;All QUOTED! are truthy!&quot;]
    All QUOTED! are truthy!

This means the loop can gracefully recover the QUOTED! as the ALL result if the loop completes, and remove the quoting level:

    &gt;&gt; for-both x [1 2] [3 4] [print [x], x = 5]
    1
    2
    3
    4
    == #[false]

### It Solves the Fallout From The Last Loop Body

This takes advantage of a new invariant: ***loops which never run their bodies return void***.

    &gt;&gt; for-each x [] [fail &quot;This body never runs&quot;]
    ; void (decays to none)

Voids act invisibly in constructs like ALL.  So we get the result we want:

    &gt;&gt; for-both x [1 2] [] [print [x], x * 10]
    1  ; evaluated to 10
    2  ; evaluated to 20
    == 20

There&#39;s a slight fib here, that META of the void did not produce a &quot;meta-void&quot; (@void)...but passed it through as it would a NULL.  That&#39;s a &quot;user-friendly&quot; property of the META-as-a-word form:

    &gt;&gt; meta comment &quot;META-the-word passes through the vanishing void isotopes&quot;
    ; void (decays to none)

    &gt;&gt; ^ comment &quot;The ^ operator is more exact, gives the meta signal&quot;
    == @void

But in situations like this, passing through the void state is what we wanted.

### You Can Even Return NULL From the Body!

Thanks to isotopes, the following is possible:

    &gt;&gt; x: for-both x [1 2] [] [print [x], if x = 2 [null]]
    1
    2
    == ~null~  ; isotope (decays to null)

    &gt;&gt; x
    ; null

How cool is that?  Even though NULL is being reserved as the unique signal for loops breaking, there&#39;s a backchannel for it to escape...out of the FOR-EACH, and up out of the FOR-BOTH wrapping it!

## It Holds Up Under Scrutiny!

I&#39;m really pleased with it, and here are some tests:

I invite you to test it some more...ask questions...and perhaps come up with your own loop compositions!

<p>I chose to add a RETURN just so that it didn't look too "foreign".  (Or at least so that this talking-point example can focus its foreignness on the explanation of META and UNMETA).</p>
