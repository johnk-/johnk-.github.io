    <title>Should &quot;Arity-2 INTO&quot; in UPARSE actually just be... PARSE?</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/should-arity-2-into-in-uparse-actually-just-be-parse/1864</link>
    <description>There&#39;s a cool feature that UPARSE&#39;s INTO is willing to take a rule that gives the boundaries of the data you want to copy, and will make the copy for you:

    &gt;&gt; uparse &quot;(1 1 1)&quot; [
        into [between &quot;(&quot; &quot;)&quot;] [data: &lt;here&gt; (print mold data) some integer!]
    ]

That will give you:

    &quot;1 1 1&quot;  ; notice no &quot;)&quot; because the INTO copied the data spanning the rule
    == 1

*(I threw in the INTEGER! transcode for fun there.  Note that Red allows the transcoding rules for datatypes as well, but only on BINARY! input series. It&#39;s because they don&#39;t have UTF-8 everywhere, they&#39;d have to rewrite their scanner to process variable-width strings. One of the uncountable Ren-C design advantages...)*

More generally, you can pass any variable you want to INTO.

    &gt;&gt; uparse [1 2 3] [some integer! into (&quot;aaa&quot;) some &quot;a&quot;]
    == &quot;a&quot;

## But... Couldn&#39;t We Just Call That PARSE?

This arity-2 INTO takes an input, and rules.  Why isn&#39;t that just PARSE?

Difference is that since it&#39;s inside a parse already, its first parameter will be treated as a rule and use the synthesized result...unless you put it in a GROUP!.  But that&#39;s implicit.  Maybe call it SUBPARSE to be clear?

It would free up the keyword INTO, maybe to be compatible with historical single-arity version, for cases that have already figured out they&#39;re at a series value and don&#39;t want to repeat themselves by giving a rule that matches where they know they are.</description>

</aside>
<p>Another argument for why to call it SUBPARSE is my proposal for functions automatically becoming combinators if they fit a certain pattern.</p>
<p>That pattern is to take an INPUT and then have on their return results something indicating progress.</p>
<p>What would happen then would be the function would act like a combinator...having one less parameter than usual (e.g. the INPUT is now implicit, from the data being parsed).</p>
<p>This would make PARSE an arity-1 synonym for <strong><code>SUBPARSE &lt;HERE&gt;</code></strong>, not plain SUBPARSE.</p>
<p>Whether UPARSE actually chooses to bend its interface to be willing to act as that combinator or not, it's still a point of coherence.  I'd say that pushes it over the edge to say it shouldn't be called just PARSE.  SUBPARSE seems good.</p>

            <p>I would just call it parse. We're in a different dialect there, so one has to be aware of that anyway.</p>
<p>Dialects all the way down.</p>
