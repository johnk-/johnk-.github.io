    <title>Thinking About Isotopes Logically: ~true~ and ~false~</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/thinking-about-isotopes-logically-true-and-false/1944</link>
    <description>Here&#39;s an idea: what if **~true~** and **~false~** are examples of weird isotopic exceptions.

Let&#39;s say you could assign them to variables...and fetch them from variables...without erroring:

    &gt;&gt; true: ~true~
    == ~true~  ; isotope

    &gt;&gt; false: ~false~
    == ~false~  ; isotope

    &gt;&gt; obj: make object! [y: true, n: false]
    == make object! [
         y: ~true~
         n: ~false~
    ]

*(not being quoted in the assignment indicates they become their isotopic forms.)*

This is typically not legal...accessing a WORD! isotope from a variable like true would be an error.  But these would be special (like how I&#39;m suggesting isotopic ACTION! would be special in running the action from a word reference...)

Things that tested for truthiness would treat them as expected, considering the ~false~ isotope to be a falsey thing:

    &gt;&gt; any [true false]
    == ~true~  ; isotope

    &gt;&gt; all [true false]
    ; null

*Being isotopes comes with a constraint*...you couldn&#39;t put them into blocks.  You&#39;d have to ^META them (which would lose their special status, turning them into QUASI-WORD!s...that were truthy.

    &gt;&gt; ^ false
    == ~false~

    &gt;&gt; if ^ false [print &quot;Meta false is truthy&quot;]
    Meta false is truthy

The functions TRUE? and FALSE? could then work on isotopic, non-isotopic, or word forms of TRUE and FALSE...but error if passed other values.

* **This should work for casual cases of just having variables that hold a true or false state...and gives a good appearance for knowing what you&#39;re looking at.**

* **It builds on standard mechanisms, and hence if you need to promote the isotopic state into something that can be represented in a block you can do so... with the caveat that once you do, it will no longer reflect its logical property when used with IF and such.**

     * **That&#39;s true for NULL being ^META promoted and put in blocks as well.**

**And crucially: Since you know isotopes can&#39;t be in blocks--and if we say BLANK! is truthy as well--then you&#39;d be guaranteed to visit all the items in a block with code like this:**

    while [item: try take block] [
        print mold item
    ]

This is easily the best idea so far for dealing with the problem.</description>

            <p>I just booted an isotopic true/false system... and...</p>
<h2>YES!  Isotopic ~true~ and ~false~ is The Answer (<em>for the Core</em>)</h2>
<p>Note that I don't think it's up to me to say whether any particular use case wants an IF statement to react to things.  The whole idea is that you can rig it up however you want.</p>
<p><strong>To pick an example: Some people may have a very good reason to have <em>their</em> IF consider integer 0 falsey when writing certain kinds of code.</strong>  I think that being able to "skin" the system in usermode so it does that--and runs that code in the same session as modules which don't do that--is a good goal to shoot for.</p>
<p><em>But the system needs a firm foundation for making those variations, and to hopefully inspire people not to change it when they see why the choice was made</em>.  And from what I'm seeing so far, this really does feel like it:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; true
== ~true~ ; isotope

&gt;&gt; false
== ~false~ ; isotope

&gt;&gt; if true [print "Works!"]
Works!

&gt;&gt; if false [print "As expected!"]
; void
</code></pre>
<p>There's huge benefit to isotopes not being able to be put in blocks...it forces some kind of triage.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; compose [a (1 = 1) b]
** Script Error: Invalid use of ~true~ isotope
</code></pre>
<p><strong>The tendency of historical Redbol to render #[true] and #[false] and #[none] indistinguishable from the WORD!s true, false, and none was not an accident:</strong> it was a crude attempt to limit the leakage of literal values that people <em>often</em> did not want to see.  But the results were outright misleading.</p>
<p>Here we get cued into a choice of how to shape our structures.  For instance: if you want the QUASI!-WORD! of ~true~, you can do that by reifying it:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; compose [a (reify 1 = 1) b]
== [a ~true~ b]
</code></pre>
<p>Or if you wanted the WORD! true, then you can go that direction as well:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; compose [a (as word! 1 = 1) b]
== [a true b]
</code></pre>
<p>And if someone thinks they have a really good reason to default one way or another, they can customize it.  But to me, erroring has the right level of agonsticism for the core.</p>
<p>Fitting into that balance is that ~true~ and ~false~ are the only isotopes that the core IF and friends will accept, so you still get a decent amount of safety:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; ~xxx~
== ~xxx~  ; isotope

&gt;&gt; if ~xxx~ [print "other isotopes still error"]
** Script Error: if needs condition as ^META for ~xxx~ isotope
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>~true~</code> and <code>~false~</code> QUASI!-words remain themselves truthy, for all the various good reasons they should be truthy (as the WORD!s true and false are as well).</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; first [~false~]  ; getting unevaluated out of block, so not isotopic
== ~false~

&gt;&gt; if first [~false~] [print "plain unevaluated ~false~ is truthy"]
plain unevaluated ~false~ is truthy

&gt;&gt; decay first [~false~]
== ~false~  ; isotope

&gt;&gt; if decay first [~false~] [print "decayed ~false~ is falsey!"]
decayed ~false~ is falsey!
</code></pre>
<p><em>There are measurable feature benefits to having IF and CASE and ANY defaulting to testing an ANY-VALUE! like that for "is-ness".</em>  It solves many puzzles of trying to author generic block manipulation code cleanly.</p>
<h2>It's a Morale Boost On A Top-Of-The-Page Problem</h2>
<p>For years I've scrolled past the first steps of the boot process, and in the very early boot it has a bit that does an initialization of global cells holding true and false literals.</p>
<p>So right up when you step into main() you hit an essay about how #[true] and #[false] kind of suck, no literal notation has been chosen, along with all the historical question of the duality between the always-truthy true and false words with the literals...</p>
<p>It has been a chronic bummer to see it and lament that "we don't even know what to do with true and false!"  <em>But here is an answer that looks and functions better than anything before it.</em></p>
<p>It's hard to say when things are "fully solved" but this is feeling darn near close.  Which means the nest major step in the puzzle will be being able to achieve those customizations I speak of... e.g. to make INTEGER! of 0 falsey, but not have to rewrite every logic-oriented function in the system to do it...</p>
