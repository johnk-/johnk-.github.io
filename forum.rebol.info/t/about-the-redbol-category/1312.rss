    <title>About the Redbol category</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/about-the-redbol-category/1312</link>
    <description>Issues regarding compatibility and emulation of [Rebol2](http://www.rebol.com/docs/docs.html) and [Red](https://www.red-lang.org/p/about.html), as well as other things that would loosely be considered &quot;Rebol-family&quot; languages.

It&#39;s generally a goal that Ren-C be able to bend in order to do most anything that they can do...with modest effort.  Pursuant to that goal is the [Redbol module](https://github.com/metaeducation/redbol/) to have an actual emulation of a reasonable compatible subset of the (non-GUI) portion of the languages.

More generally, this category is for discussing anything related to Rebol2 or Red semantics or features.

*Note: R3-Alpha emulation is considered uninteresting, as it never gained much traction.  Most R3-Alpha codebases are either dead, [one of Oldes&#39;s projects](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3), or have been subsumed into Ren-C projects.*</description>
