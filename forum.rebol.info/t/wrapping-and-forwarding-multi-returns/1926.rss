It seemed clearly preferable that rather than choose between **[x]:** and **[x y]:** and knowing in advance how many values you&#39;re taking or throwing away... someone who only asked for one value should be able to be blissfully ignorant. So the choice would be between:

    &gt;&gt; x: multi-return ...
    &gt;&gt; [x y]: multi-return ...

Even though the first case is a multiple return, you wouldn&#39;t set x to a block of values, *but just get the first value*. An interface like this would also solve the issue of returning NULL.

Yup, sounds really useful.

One question, what do functions see? 

    f: function [a][]
    f multi-return

Does f get the return as a block, or the first value?

What happens with multiple parameters in f? With refinements? With variadics? When f is enfixed?</description>

            <h2>Back To Basics: What About (almost) <em>NO</em> SET-BLOCK! Behavior?</h2>
<p>I realized that what I was trying to do was to split the behavior of multiple returns across two parts: the SET-BLOCK! on the left, and the function dispatcher mechanics on the right.</p>
<p>However you slice that, it means the SET-BLOCK! winds up asking for something from its right-hand side besides <em>"give me the single result of your evaluation"</em>.  That requires baking some kind of protocol in at a pretty deep level.</p>
<p>But what if SET-BLOCK! was "dumb" by default.  All it would do would be to set the first item to the evaluation of the right hand side, and unset the rest:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; [x y]: 1020
== 1020

&gt;&gt; x
== 1020

&gt;&gt; unset? 'y
== #[true]
</code></pre>
<p>Then we could basically say that all multi-return functions are actually enfix, and take a SET-BLOCK! on the left hand side that's <code>&lt;skip&gt;</code>-able.</p>
<p>They'd have a little prelude which would evaluate any groups in the block on the left hand side first (so things are coherent left=&gt;right).  Then they'd run their body, and have an epilogue which did the writeback to the variables.</p>
<h2>But Isn't That <a href="https://forum.rebol.info/t/multiple-return-values-via-enfix/1257">How Multi-Return Was <em>Protyped</em>?</a>
</h2>
<p>Well, yes.  <strong><a href="https://forum.rebol.info/t/a-lot-to-unpack-replacing-the-set-of-reduce-block-idiom/1634">And it's how UNPACK works</a>.</strong></p>
<p><em>I never said making all FUNCs that were multi-return implement themselves as enfix was a <strong>bad</strong> idea.</em></p>
<p>In fact, given UNPACK as an example...I think it shows that a sort of "sky's the limit" definition of how your function chooses to interact with a SET-BLOCK! is really more interesting than trying to come up with some standard definition of what a "multi-return" is.</p>
<pre><code>[&lt;special-instruction&gt; a *]: your-special-function ...
</code></pre>
<p>We can have some basic expectations (and if you're going to use an unmodified LET you'll have to accept a few of those, though it passes through TAG!s and such).</p>
<h2>Equally Broken with GROUP!s, but Answers for APPLY etc.</h2>
<p>Trying to formalize multi-return beyond enfix wasn't really leading to anything better.</p>
<p>For instance, allowing GROUP!s might sound nice, which enfix definitely can't do:</p>
<pre><code>[value rest]: transcode data

[value rest]: (transcode data)
</code></pre>
<p>But once you're "inside the system" with the power to do more, do you really want to?  What about:</p>
<pre><code>[value rest]: (transcode data, 1 + 2)

[value rest]: ((^(transcode data)))
</code></pre>
<p>Trying to pick which of these situations you're going to rig a protocol around is dicey.  Also, how would you solve something like:</p>
<pre><code>[value rest]: apply :transcode [data]
</code></pre>
<p><em><strong>The enfix actually gives us an answer.</strong></em>   APPLY can just notice that :transcode is interested in things on its left hand side, and give it the SET-BLOCK!...proxied as a parameter.  The same thing will work for UNPACK, even with things like its weird ellipsis semantics for "ignore additional values":</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; [a b ...]: apply :unpack [reverse [&lt;dropme&gt; 304 1020]]
== 1020

&gt;&gt; a
== 1020

&gt;&gt; b
== 304
</code></pre>
<p><em>So being dumber is actually smarter,</em> in this particular case.</p>

            <p>That was six questions.  <img src="https://forum.rebol.info/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>Does f get the return as a block, or the first value?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The current implementation has it so that f would only receives the first value (main return) of the multi-return.</p>
<p>But that raises some pretty big questions about how you'd deal with situations where that's not sufficient.</p>
<h2>A Huge Question: Forwarding</h2>
<p>The premise this is operating on is that <em>multiple return-valued functions are a fundamentally different beast</em>.  Any single value goes through assignment normally to the first slot:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; [x y]: [1 2]
== [1 2]

&gt;&gt; x
== [1 2]

&gt;&gt; y
== ~  ; isotope
</code></pre>
<p>This magical property of functions has a bit of a problem, though...</p>
<pre><code>my-wrapper: func [arg1 arg2] [
     return multi-return arg1 arg2
]
</code></pre>
<p>If MULTI-RETURN has the property that it would assign multiply to a SET-BLOCK! target, then you'd lose that multiple-return-ness.  You can't have it both ways...a value like a BLOCK! can represent a single multi-valued item, or multiple values, but not both at the same time.</p>
<p>It seems clear there'd need to be some kind of operator for unpacking and repacking a multi-valued function's results into a BLOCK!.  Since UNPACK is taken, let's call them BUNDLE and UNBUNDLE:</p>
<pre><code> &gt;&gt; one: multi-returns-10-and-20
 == 10  ; drops 20, not requested

 &gt;&gt; both: bundle multi-returns-10-and-20
 == [10 20]  ; assume request is for *all*?

 &gt;&gt; [x y]: unbundle [10 20]
 == 10

 &gt;&gt; x
 == 10

 &gt;&gt; y
 == 20
</code></pre>
<p>That doesn't help with the wrapping problem, though.  You'd need some kind of <em>forwarding return</em>.  Perhaps something like a <strong>return/bundle</strong>?</p>
<p>It might seem nice to make forwarding the default, but this would lead to counter-intuitive situations, like these two being different:</p>
<pre><code> return some-function

 x: some-function
 return x
</code></pre>
<p>It feels like you'd want <em>some</em> kind of signal before having these act differently.</p>
