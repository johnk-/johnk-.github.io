    <title>Extending Contexts (OBJECT!, MODULE!, etc)</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/extending-contexts-object-module-etc/1913</link>
    <description>In R3-Alpha, it is possible to append key/value pairs to objects via a block:

    &gt;&gt; obj: make object! [a: 10]
    == make object! [
       a: 10
    ]

    &gt;&gt; append obj [b: 20 c: 30]
    == make object! [
        a: 10
        b: 20
        c: 30
    ]

You can&#39;t do that in Rebol2, and Red did not carry it forward.

**But in Ren-C, isotopes are not allowed in blocks.**  It&#39;s more powerful if there is an operation which extends the object via a block which gets evaluated... much as the block in MAKE OBJECT! is evaluated.

As a general rule, APPEND should certainly not be REDUCE-ing block arguments.  So some other operation is needed 

Red has an EXTEND operation, but it is &quot;reserved for future use&quot;:

    USAGE:
         EXTEND obj spec

    DESCRIPTION: 
         Extend an object or map value with list of key and value pairs. 
         EXTEND is a native! value.

    ARGUMENTS:
         obj          [object! map!] 
         spec         [block! hash! map!] 

    REFINEMENTS:
         /case        =&gt; Use case-sensitive comparison.

Given that it&#39;s not implemented, we don&#39;t know if that spec block is intended to be evaluated or not.  Also, we&#39;d assume EXTEND would create a new object (since their objects don&#39;t expand).

Anyway, APPEND to an OBJECT! is something that probably doesn&#39;t make sense.</description>

<p>Interesting that Red's EXTEND differs from R3-Alpha's. I'd speculate that the spec would be REDUCED and APPENDED similar to your APPEND block there consistent with MAKE OBJECT! [...]</p>
