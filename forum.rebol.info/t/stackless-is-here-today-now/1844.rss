    <title>Stackless Is Here, Today, Now! :pancakes:</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/stackless-is-here-today-now/1844</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve explained why we need stacklessness:

**[Switching to Stackless: Why this, why now?](https://forum.rebol.info/t/switching-to-stackless-why-this-why-now/1247)**

It&#39;s taken a lot of thinking.  But as proof that it&#39;s real, you can try this:

    &gt;&gt; counter: func [value] [
          if 0 = modulo value 1000 [print [value]]
          counter value + 1
      ]

How many stack levels you get will depend on the available memory of your platform--not your CPU stack.

In the WebAssembly build that runs in the browser, I got this on Chromium on Linux:

    &gt;&gt; counter 0
    0
    1000
    2000
    3000
    4000
    5000
    6000
    7000
    8000
    9000
    10000
    11000
    12000
    13000
    14000
    15000
    16000
    17000

It just terminates, but the error that shows up in the browser console is:

&gt; Uncaught RuntimeError: Aborted(Cannot enlarge memory arrays to size 16867328 bytes (OOM). Either (1) compile with -sINITIAL_MEMORY=X with X higher than the current value 16777216, (2) compile with -sALLOW_MEMORY_GROWTH which allows increasing the size at runtime, or (3) if you want malloc to return NULL (0) instead of this abort, compile with -sABORTING_MALLOC=0)

The same amount was gotten on Firefox, probably because emscripten requests the same amount of Wasm memory space on each.

## Point Is, It Ran Out of Memory... not Stack!

We can see there&#39;s work to do on responding to out-of-memory errors (we&#39;ve never really had a great story for that).  *But at least we can (!)* -- I&#39;ve explained already that stack overflows can&#39;t be caught the way a failed memory allocation can.  That&#39;s a huge motivator for the change.

But still, over 17000 stack levels is kind of neat in and of itself!

So how do desktop executables &quot;stack up&quot;, on my 16-core Lenovo ThinkPad i7 with 64GB of memory...?

As a quick comparison: for Red on Windows, it doesn&#39;t make it to 2000:

    red&gt;&gt; counter 0
    0
    1000
    *** Internal Error: stack overflow
    *** Where: %
    *** Stack: counter counter counter counter counter counter counter counter coun
    ter counter counter counter counter counter counter counter counter counter cou
    nter counter counter counter counter counter counter counter counter counter co
    unter counter counter coun...

Running an actual count got me to 1943 and then it crashed.

*(I take it that encountering a stack overflow -during- a PRINT leads them to a harsher situation than just during a recursion.  But this is all the more reason you can&#39;t play fast-and-loose with the CPU stack, it cannot be trapped like an out of memory error!  Right now we may be crashing too, but it&#39;s substantially closer to being managed.)*

For Rebol2 on Windows it makes it to 14262, and does not crash.  (So Red&#39;s an order of magnitude worse, and crashes.)

I hadn&#39;t built a 32-bit optimized Windows executable for a while (and actually had to fix a couple of compiler warnings to get one).  But I figured I&#39;d do so for an apples-to-apples comparison with the Rebol2 and Red EXEs.

32-bit Ren-C makes it to...well, jeez.  Printing it out one by one could go on forever, so I tried only doing a print on modulo 10,000.  It starts to slow down a bit around 2 million, but ticks past 3 million pretty easily...and makes it to 4 million.  It eventually terminates without a message at 4780000 (it&#39;s an optimized build, and our out-of memory handling needs work...this would likely be an assert in a debug build).

So generously rounding Red up to 2,000... Ren-C can handle over 2000x the stack levels, at least.  :-)

## Now, To Reap The Benefits...

* &lt;strike&gt;I need to rework the JavaScript extension to use this intrinsic stackless property, instead of &quot;Asyncify&quot;.&lt;/strike&gt;  DONE!

   * Asyncify gave us the pseudo-stackless ability of suspending arbitrary non-stackless code in order to run browser events.  This let us do things like ASK for input while in the middle of a loop.  With real stackless, we (shouldn&#39;t) need that.

   * Asyncify added bloat to our code generation that I recall making the .wasm about double the size.  We&#39;ll see how accurate my memory is on that, but hopefully the size of libr3.wasm will go way down.

* &lt;strike&gt;One by one the natives have to be redone to stackless.  Only then can we truly ditch Asyncify, because if something like FOR-EACH isn&#39;t stackless we wouldn&#39;t be able to do something like PRINT or ASK inside of that kind of loop... it would raise an error.&lt;/strike&gt;  MOSTLY DONE!

    * We can probably punt on some things and drop asyncify even if not everything is stackless yet.

    * You might not be able to do something like **`foo.(ask &quot;Field Name?&quot;): 10`** until TUPLE! lookup has stackless processing bubble up through its GROUP! evaluations, but I think we can live with that being an error for a while--if it halves the size of the wasm.

* Generators and Yielders need to be resurrected.  They were pretty well designed before, but locking issues created headaches...and it&#39;s time to attack those again.

* Out-of-memory errors have to be reined in--not just so stack overflows can be handled gracefully, but that any kind of out-of-memory is handled gracefully!

    * We also might want users to be able to set a policy (if they wish) to limit the stack before memory runs out, just so that infinite recursions get caught earlier in casual programs that aren&#39;t intentionally using big stacks.

In any case, it feels good to get the core of the work done two years ago hammered into shape...and see it running in the browser!</description>

            <p>I thought it would be informative to do a quick comparison of code, to see how something stackless is implemented...and how "messy" (or not) it makes things that were "formerly simple".</p>

<li>
<p>It was considered if <code>while true [...]</code> should infinite loop, and then     <code>while false [...]</code> never ran.  However, that could lead to accidents of like <code>while x &gt; 10 [...]</code> instead of <code>while [x &gt; 10] [...]</code>.  It is probably safer to require a BLOCK! vs. falling back on such behaviors.  (It's now easy for people to make their own weird polymorphic loops.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We could make it so CONTINUE in the condition of a WHILE meant you skip the execution of the body of that loop, and run the condition again.  That <em>might</em> be interesting for some strange stylized usage that puts complex branching code in a condition.  But it adds some cost, and would override the default meaning of CONTINUE (of continuing some enclosing loop)...which is free, and enables other strange stylized usages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If someone writes:</p>
<pre><code>flag: okay
while [flag] [flag: null, null]
</code></pre>
<p>We don't want the overall WHILE result to evaluate to NULL--because NULL is reserved for signaling BREAK.  Similarly, VOID results are reserved for when the body never runs.  BRANCHED() encloses these states in single-element packs.</p>

<p>Uncaught RuntimeError: Aborted(Cannot enlarge memory arrays to size 16867328 bytes (OOM). Either (1) compile with -sINITIAL_MEMORY=X with X higher than the current value 16777216, (2) compile with -sALLOW_MEMORY_GROWTH which allows increasing the size at runtime, or (3) if you want malloc to return NULL (0) instead of this abort, compile with -sABORTING_MALLOC=0)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The same amount was gotten on Firefox, probably because emscripten requests the same amount of Wasm memory space on each.</p>

<p>We can see there's work to do on responding to out-of-memory errors (we've never really had a great story for that).  <em>But at least we can (!)</em> -- I've explained already that stack overflows can't be caught the way a failed memory allocation can.  That's a huge motivator for the change.</p>
<p>But still, over 17000 stack levels is kind of neat in and of itself!</p>
<p>So how do desktop executables "stack up", on my 16-core Lenovo ThinkPad i7 with 64GB of memory...?</p>
<p>As a quick comparison: for Red on Windows, it doesn't make it to 2000:</p>
<pre><code>red&gt;&gt; counter 0
0
1000
*** Internal Error: stack overflow
*** Where: %
*** Stack: counter counter counter counter counter counter counter counter coun
ter counter counter counter counter counter counter counter counter counter cou
nter counter counter counter counter counter counter counter counter counter co
unter counter counter coun...
</code></pre>
<p>Running an actual count got me to 1943 and then it crashed.</p>
<p><em>(I take it that encountering a stack overflow -during- a PRINT leads them to a harsher situation than just during a recursion.  But this is all the more reason you can't play fast-and-loose with the CPU stack, it cannot be trapped like an out of memory error!  Right now we may be crashing too, but it's substantially closer to being managed.)</em></p>
<p>For Rebol2 on Windows it makes it to 14262, and does not crash.  (So Red's an order of magnitude worse, and crashes.)</p>
<p>I hadn't built a 32-bit optimized Windows executable for a while (and actually had to fix a couple of compiler warnings to get one).  But I figured I'd do so for an apples-to-apples comparison with the Rebol2 and Red EXEs.</p>
<p>32-bit Ren-C makes it to...well, jeez.  Printing it out one by one could go on forever, so I tried only doing a print on modulo 10,000.  It starts to slow down a bit around 2 million, but ticks past 3 million pretty easily...and makes it to 4 million.  It eventually terminates without a message at 4780000 (it's an optimized build, and our out-of memory handling needs work...this would likely be an assert in a debug build).</p>
<p>So generously rounding Red up to 2,000... Ren-C can handle over 2000x the stack levels, at least.  <img src="https://forum.rebol.info/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strike>I need to rework the JavaScript extension to use this intrinsic stackless property, instead of "Asyncify".</strike>  DONE!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Asyncify gave us the pseudo-stackless ability of suspending arbitrary non-stackless code in order to run browser events.  This let us do things like ASK for input while in the middle of a loop.  With real stackless, we (shouldn't) need that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Asyncify added bloat to our code generation that I recall making the .wasm about double the size.  We'll see how accurate my memory is on that, but hopefully the size of libr3.wasm will go way down.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strike>One by one the natives have to be redone to stackless.  Only then can we truly ditch Asyncify, because if something like FOR-EACH isn't stackless we wouldn't be able to do something like PRINT or ASK inside of that kind of loop... it would raise an error.</strike>  MOSTLY DONE!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We can probably punt on some things and drop asyncify even if not everything is stackless yet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You might not be able to do something like <strong><code>foo.(ask "Field Name?"): 10</code></strong> until TUPLE! lookup has stackless processing bubble up through its GROUP! evaluations, but I think we can live with that being an error for a while--if it halves the size of the wasm.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Generators and Yielders need to be resurrected.  They were pretty well designed before, but locking issues created headaches...and it's time to attack those again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Out-of-memory errors have to be reined in--not just so stack overflows can be handled gracefully, but that any kind of out-of-memory is handled gracefully!</p>
<ul>
<li>We also might want users to be able to set a policy (if they wish) to limit the stack before memory runs out, just so that infinite recursions get caught earlier in casual programs that aren't intentionally using big stacks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In any case, it feels good to get the core of the work done two years ago hammered into shape...and see it running in the browser!</p>
