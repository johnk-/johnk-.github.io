    <title>MAKE Should Be Using *Dialected Constructors*</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/make-should-be-using-dialected-constructors/2196</link>
    <description>[quote=&quot;hostilefork, post:1, topic:1591&quot;]
No one really uses the &quot;polymorphism&quot; of **make some-type some-definition** without really knowing what type or definition is, right? That seems essentially meaningless.
[/quote]

In thinking more about &quot;what is MAKE&quot;, I feel like it is fundamentally a constructor.

---

When you think about Rebol&#39;s value proposition vs. other languages, what&#39;s the key idea?

**DIALECTS.**  The freeform Jazz of programming.  :saxophone:

---

So what should be the differentiating factor about constructors in Rebol vs. other languages?

**CONSTRUCTOR DIALECTS.** :saxophone: :guitar: :drum: :musical_keyboard: 

---

When I say **`make my-type! [...]`** then what goes in that BLOCK! needs to be delegated to MY-TYPE! in some way to allow it the freedom to interpret the hell out of that block.

And it shouldn&#39;t only be allowed to be a BLOCK! full of madness.  Consistent with history where you can write things like **`(make block! 10)`** to preallocate a size, you should be able to pass anything you want.

    make my-type! &#39;some-word

    make my-type! /some-refinement

    make my-type! ${...}  ; gimme a bound FENCE!

    make my-type! @[...]  ; special meaning if &quot;inert&quot; block received?

---

### History Has Ridiculously Underformed The Potential

When you look at the TO/MAKE Matrix, it&#39;s full of meaningless choices:

    rebol2&gt;&gt; make block! [a b c]
    == [a b c]

Huh?  What the hell use is that.  Is it a copy?  Is it a deep copy?  *[Where&#39;s the beef?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U80ebi4AKgs)*
    
Why isn&#39;t the constructor for block a literate landscape, subsuming the functionality of [ARRAY](http://www.rebol.com/docs/words/warray.html) (a terrible name for a verb) and much more?

    &gt;&gt; make block! [4/8 initial: &#39;*]
    == [* * * *]  ; length 4, capacity 8, initialize elements with *

    &gt;&gt; make block! /8
    == []  ; just capacity 8

    &gt;&gt; make block! 4
    == [~ ~ ~ ~]  ; default to TRASH

There&#39;s an answer here that &quot;dialect design is hard&quot;, and it&#39;s scary to put a dialect in the core.  But there&#39;s decades of experience at this point.  And maybe even ways for people to do their own rewrites and transformations so they don&#39;t have to use a **`make-block`** function but can customize **`make block!`** itself.

---

### Ren-C Has Opened Up The Skies, and Will Do More

I was musing on the behavior of FENCE! in the interpreter and thought, what if it wasn&#39;t narrowly defined as being OBJECT! related.  *What if it was MAKE-related, with an object-generating default?*

    &gt;&gt; {x: 10, y: 20}
    == #[object! x: 10 y: 20]

    &gt;&gt; {[block!] 4/8 initial: &#39;*}  ; maybe leading block means MAKE that?
    == [* * * *]

    &gt;&gt; {block! {4/8 initial: &#39;*}}  ; maybe nesting FENCE! does it?
    == [* * * *]

    &gt;&gt; {block! 4/8 initial: &#39;*}  ; maybe starting with WORD! is enough?
    == [* * * *]

    &gt;&gt; {group!}  ; synonym for -&gt; copy &#39;() ?
    == ()

It&#39;s a half-baked thought, and I don&#39;t know what the ideal syntax is.  But I feel like this could make FENCE! so much more.

## So Coming Soon: The Great MAKE Purge.

In the combinatoric TO/MAKE matrix, there is a ton of garbage.

I&#39;ve previously suggested that TO should not do any evaluation (e.g. be binding agnostic on what it gets in).  I think that remains a good idea, that it be purely mechanical.  [I had some other ideas that are lingering.](https://forum.rebol.info/t/hacking-away-on-the-to-and-make-matrix/649)

I think it&#39;s time to further cull the &quot;MAKE for the sake of thinking everything you pass needs to do something, even if it&#39;s trivial.&quot;  I&#39;ve been wiping out some of the garbage, but more is needed.

And we have to find a way to give users the ability to hook MAKE on their objects... such that something like **`make point-3D! [...]`** isn&#39;t locked into a trivial extension syntax of SET-WORD! and value, but truly able to do interesting things.</description>

</aside>
<p>As it so happens, <strong><code>//</code></strong> is going to be APPLY now <a href="https://forum.rebol.info/t/big-alien-proposal-word-runs-functions/1905/13">due to slash's intimate tie to function execution</a>.</p>
<p>So <strong><code>::</code></strong> may be a reasonable candidate here, but I feel it needs to be optional.</p>
<p>In terms of strange musings on the power of FENCE!, I had an idea that it might be used to cast INTEGER! to DECIMAL!</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; number: 1020

&gt;&gt; {. number}
== 1020.0
</code></pre>
<p>Though here is where we get into keyword territory, because <strong><code>.</code></strong> would be redefinable (and it's looking like it will often be defined as a "this" or "self", to go along with <strong><code>.member</code></strong> acting as member selection).</p>
<p>So you couldn't do <strong><code>.: &amp;[block]</code></strong> and get <strong><code>{. 4}</code></strong> to act like <strong><code>{block! 4}</code></strong>, you'd get <code>4.0</code></p>
<p>I'm wary of building in things like this, but we do have them built in here and there.</p>

<p>Something worth pointing out here is that this gives you an elegance ARRAY can't do, because you have the type.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; {[group!] 4/8 initial: '*}
== (* * * *)

&gt;&gt; {[the-fence!] 4 initial: '* /8}
== @{* * * *}

&gt;&gt; {[set-group!] 4}
== (~ ~ ~ ~):
</code></pre>
<p>This is pretty compelling.</p>
<p>ARRAY would need to be passed an additional parameter--either unconditionally or as a refinement.</p>
<p>I'll point out that I don't like the idea of something like:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; {set-group! | 4}
== (~ ~ ~ ~):
</code></pre>
<p>Because FENCE!'s behavior would be built into the evaluator, and it's not nice to assume meaning for a WORD! like <strong><code>|</code></strong>.  Better to cue off positions and "nonverbal" cues (no WORD!)</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; {[set-group!] 4}
== (~ ~ ~ ~):

</aside>
<p>Perhaps the most Rebol-y thing to do is to let you pick.</p>
<p>If you think it's clear enough to leave the block off, do so.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; {fence! 4}

&gt;&gt; group: {group! /7}

&gt;&gt; capacity of group

<p>We do have the colon SIGIL! now, but that's pretty close to <strong><code>fence!: 4</code></strong>.  We could say that :: in this context doesn't mean APPLY...</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; {fence! : 4}

&gt;&gt; {fence! :: 4}
