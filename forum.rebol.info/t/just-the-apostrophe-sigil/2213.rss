    <title>JUST the APOSTROPHE (&#39;) SIGIL!</title>

    <description>*This ties together quite nicely.  cc: @bradrn*

So I&#39;d been fretting over whether **`@`** would bind the thing you passed it or not.  It had to bind things for the system to work, so I went with that... even though it may not be what you want in all cases:

    &gt;&gt; abc: 10
    
    &gt;&gt; word: @ abc
    == abc
    
    &gt;&gt; get word
    == 10

**`@foo`** is a THE-WORD! and so **`@`** makes sense as a synonym for an operator called THE.

    &gt;&gt; the abc
    == abc ; bound

But what if you don&#39;t want a binding?  THE/UNBOUND?  Is there no symbol?

## A Part In The Box Becomes Available: APOSTROPHE (&#39;)

For a very long time, apostrophe was considered the quoted form of VOID (or NULL, before void existed).  So it evaluated to void, and voids were invisible in the console:

    &gt;&gt; if false [print &quot;conditional returns void&quot;]

    &gt;&gt; meta if false [print &quot;conditional returns void&quot;]
    &#39;

    &gt;&gt; quote void
    == &#39;

    &gt;&gt; append [a b c] &#39;
    == [a b c]

***&quot;Isn&#39;t that cool&quot;***, I thought.  ***&quot;Void is the absence of anything, and so when you quote it you get just a lone apostrophe.  And when the lone apostrophe boils away after removing the quote in evaluation, you have nothingness!!!  It&#39;s perfect for displaying nothing as a result!&quot;***

Slow clap.  :clap: 

It was a cute idea in the pre-isotopic era.  But once we had quasiforms and antiforms, **[making void the antiform of the word `void` has many more merits.](https://forum.rebol.info/t/why-shouldnt-void-be-done-with-a-void-word-antiform/2160)**

So lone apostrophe went back into the &quot;unused&quot; bin, and I wondered what to do with it.  What type would it be?  Couldn&#39;t be a WORD!

## But... [SIGIL! Were Invented Simultaneously To ~void~](https://forum.rebol.info/t/weird-word-s-allow-but-escape-them/1560/10?u=hostilefork)

They happened in basically the same week.  I&#39;m not sure why it didn&#39;t occur to me to make **`&#39;`** a SIGIL!

Why not?

    &gt;&gt; sigil of first [&#39;&#39;a]
    == &#39;

Now we have our non-binding literal operator.

    &gt;&gt; abc: 10
    
    &gt;&gt; word: &#39; abc
    
    &gt;&gt; get word
    ** Script Error: abc word is not bound to a context

And I think a good name for it would be... JUST:

    &gt;&gt; just abc
    == abc  ; not bound

* It&#39;s a good part of speech (LITERAL seems like a variable name)

* It&#39;s short (LITERALLY would be obnoxious)

* I think that JUST has a good shade of meaning of *&quot;just give me the array element, I don&#39;t want the extras...no pickles, no lettuce, and no binding&quot;*

## Seems Perfect To Me

This goes along with the idea of when you declare your function arguments as being literal, if you say **`&#39;foo`** for the argument you will get it with no added binding, and if you say **`@foo`** it will bind in the context of the callsite.

Anyway, they&#39;re &quot;literal arguments&quot;... not &quot;quoted arguments&quot;... because no quoting level is added.  Except perhaps an imaginary quoting level added in your head at the callsite which the evaluator strips off, but that doesn&#39;t happen.  (In fact it can&#39;t happen for @, because for anything but a plain WORD!/BLOCK!/TUPLE!/etc. there&#39;s no way to add an @ onto something like an INTEGER! or the like.)</description>

</aside>
<p>Interestingly, making apostrophe a SIGIL! winds up being different from the other sigils...</p>
<p>They can't compose, so you can't make an <strong><code>@$</code></strong> or a <strong><code>:::</code></strong> or a <strong><code>^^</code></strong>, or anything like that.</p>
<p>But the <strong><code>'</code></strong> is different, since you can quote it!</p>
<p>So <strong><code>''</code></strong> has an obvious evaluator behavior, as does <strong><code>'''</code></strong>, <strong><code>''''</code></strong>, etc.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; ''
== '

&gt;&gt; '''
== ''
</code></pre>
<p>But you don't have to use it that way in your dialects.  You now have new parts in the box: an arbitrary number of apostrophes in a row.  <em>(Ok, quote levels can only count up to 127 at present... so including the sigil for the quote you can have up to 128.)</em></p>
<p>You could use it for <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unary_numeral_system">Unary Number Representation</a></strong>!</p>
<p>But do note: the QUOTES OF won't count the sigil.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; quotes of first [''']
== 2
</code></pre>
<p>So:</p>
<pre><code>unary-to-int: func [unary] [
    assert [(just ') = heart of unary]
    return 1 + quotes of unary
]
</code></pre>
<p>It's of course necessary for quoted sigils to exist, for the whole meta-representability thing to work.</p>
<p>I just find it interesting that we have this dialecting piece again.  <em>(When apostrophe was quoted void, we also had it.)</em> I don't have any immediate ideas on dialect uses, but I bet I'll think of something.  <img src="https://forum.rebol.info/images/emoji/twitter/brain.png?v=12" title=":brain:" class="emoji" alt=":brain:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>

            <p><strong><code>@foo</code></strong> just evaluates to itself.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; @foo
== @foo  ; should be bound
</code></pre>
<p>I realize it should evaluate to itself bound.  Because if you wanted it unbound, you could just do:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; '@foo
== @foo  ; unbound
</code></pre>
<p>The $foo gives you the thing bound, but undecorated.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; $foo
== foo  ; bound
</code></pre>
<p>Then the $ operator binds what you pass it but evaluates.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; $ first [foo bar]
== foo ; bound
</code></pre>

</aside>
<p>So there's a bit of a consistency question here with quasiforms, and why you would not say:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; sigil of first [~void~]
== ~
</code></pre>
<p>We do not want it to be a SIGIL! because sigils are not quasiforms, and hence can't evaluate to antiforms, and it would break everything.  <img src="https://forum.rebol.info/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=12" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
<p>But I think this can be resolved kind of how SET-WORD! is resolved.  The sigil could be <em>two</em> tildes.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; sigil of first [:abc]
== :

&gt;&gt; sigil of first [abc:]
== ::

&gt;&gt; sigil of first [~void~]
== ~~
</code></pre>
<p>Makes more sense than the double colon sigil for SET-WORD! there.  Because after all, there are two tildes on the quasiform.  Well, except for "trash" (a.k.a. META-NOTHING, a.k.a. QUASI-BLANK):</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; sigil of first [~]
== ~~
</code></pre>
<p>Don't think I'll lose sleep over that.</p>
<p>Anyway, that seems like a good rationale for SIGIL_QUASI.  But what should it do in the evaluator?</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; ~~ [a b c]
== ~[a b c]~
</code></pre>
<p>I can't think of when I'd ever use that instead of just <strong><code>'~[a b c]~</code></strong></p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; block: [a b c]

&gt;&gt; ~~ block
== ~[a b c]~
</code></pre>
<p>That's ever so slightly more likely to be useful, but I don't mind typing <strong><code>quasi block</code></strong></p>
<p>Offhand, I don't know.  It would have to be something related to quasiforms or antiforms.  Or maybe just alarming things in general... some kind of TBD, that just errors?</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; not-implemented: foo: func [x] [~~]
** Error: ~~ encountered
</code></pre>
<p>Anyway, I'll be on the lookout for some evaluator behavior that makes life easier.</p>
