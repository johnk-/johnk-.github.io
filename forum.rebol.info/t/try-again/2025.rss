    <title>TRY... *again* :roll_eyes:</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/try-again/2025</link>
    <description>I have proposed a concept for TRY as trapping definitional errors and turning them into nulls, like this:

    &gt;&gt; take []
    ** Error: you can&#39;t take from an empty block (stopping further code)

    &gt;&gt; try take []
    == ~null~  ; anti

And I&#39;ll just give a reminder that as this is trapping [definitional errors](https://forum.rebol.info/t/fail-vs-return-raise-the-new-age-of-definitional-failures/1852).  So failures from deeper inside code would not be caught... only errors that are returned by contract from the function being called.

    &gt;&gt; try compose [(1 / 0)]
    ** Error: division by zero (e.g. COMPOSE itself didn&#39;t raise the error)

*I&#39;ll remind everyone that it&#39;s a very slippery slope to trap &quot;deep errors&quot;, and this is why the deep error trapping concept is [hidden away as `sys.util.rescue`](https://forum.rebol.info/t/discouraging-use-of-trap/1871/3))*

## Why Return NULL From TRY (vs. void) ?

The decision to return null is to make the result falsey so it can be acted on:

    while [item: try take block] [
        ...
    ]

    all [
        try take block  ; if this fails we don&#39;t want to keep going
        ...
    ]

In the vernacular I use, I call NULL &quot;soft failure&quot;.  So TRY &quot;converts a definitional failure into soft failure&quot;, passing through all other results as-is.

## Comparison with similar word MAYBE

The MAYBE operation was defined as something that converts nulls to voids, and passes through everything else.  If you didn&#39;t know that, it&#39;s easy to see not intuiting what the difference between **try take block** and **maybe take block** would be.

You can get some odd-looking combinations with this, e.g.

     &gt;&gt; block1: [a b c]
     &gt;&gt; block2: []

     &gt;&gt; append block1 maybe try take block2
     == [a b c]

Which makes one wonder if MAYBE could be used to trap definitional errors as well as nulls and turn them into voids, so you could just write **append block1 maybe take block2**.

So it raises the question: are there null-returning operations that also return definitional errors, where one would want to suppress the null but not the error?  There&#39;s not enough experience for me to say yet.</description>
