    <title>Chaining Return Types</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/chaining-return-types/1467</link>
    <description>Something that bothers me about C is that it doesn&#39;t let you write chaining void returns:

    void my_function() {
        return some_void_function(...);  /* this is not legal! */
    }

That annoys me, because it makes it hard to write generic code that doesn&#39;t want the bad properties of a macro (repeating evaluation of arguments if used multiple times, etc.)...but throws a wrench in being able to abstract across return values.

**But Ren-C has this covered!**  All states can be chained.

But what if you are writing a wrapped function, and want a type signature on the wrapper that matches what you are wrapping?  I guess we could do this via COMPOSE on the spec of some kind:

    my-function: func compose [
        return: (return-type-block-of :some-other-function)
        ...
    ][
        ...
        return some-other-function ...
    ]

Something along these lines, where you could add or remove elements of the type signature.  :-/Anyway, I just wanted to mention that we&#39;re not yet at utopia in this medium, even if we&#39;re pretty much nailing the chaining part itself!</description>
