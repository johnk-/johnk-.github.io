              <p>So at one point I had a kind of strange idea for what to do with <strong><code>&lt;-</code></strong>.</p>
<p>It would just pass through what you gave on its right.  And the idea was that you could use this in various situations as a kind of visual signal that you intended to produce a value that would be used by... something.</p>
<p>You could use it to hint when a line is being continued:</p>
<pre><code>browse join
    &lt;- https://github.com/metaeducation/ren-c/blob/master/CHANGES.md#
    &lt;- unspaced [system.version.1 "." system.version.2 "." system.version.3]
</code></pre>
<p>That JOIN is arity 2.   The arrows do nothing, but quickly pass through what they were passed.</p>
<p>The current alternative you might reach for are parentheses, but you can only put it around the outermost level, and it's noticeably inferior:</p>
<pre><code>browse (join
    https://github.com/metaeducation/ren-c/blob/master/CHANGES.md#
    unspaced [system.version.1 "." system.version.2 "." system.version.3]
)
</code></pre>
<p>I had another idea that the arrow might be nice for signaling when you're at the end of a branch to help hint that the branch result is actually used.</p>
<pre><code> something: case [
     ... [...]
     ... [...]
     ; lots of code to where SOMETHING: has scrolled off the screen
     ... [
         your code here
         more code here
         &lt;- append data "stuff"
     ]
 ]
</code></pre>
<p>It gives you a nice hint that the result of the append (the head of the appended series) is actually used.<br>
<strong>But, these two uses are in contention.</strong>  You can't use it to mean "continue the line above" and "pipe result out to some higher level.  Perhaps this is better done with an impromptu CATCH/THROW?</p>
<pre><code> something: catch [case [
     ... [... throw ...]
     ... [... throw ...]
     ; lots of code to where SOMETHING: has scrolled off the screen
     ... [
         your code here
         more code here
         throw append data "stuff"
     ]
 ]]
</code></pre>
<p>(Note that CATCH/THROW have nothing to do with errors in Rebol, it's a lightweight construct for doing this kind of manipulation.)</p>
<h2>
<a name="why-did-i-kill-off-the-as-identity-1" class="anchor" href="2165.html#why-did-i-kill-off-the-as-identity-1"></a>Why Did I Kill Off The &lt;- As Identity?</h2>
<p>It was changed shortly after deciding to take <strong>-&gt;</strong> for an infix lambda operation.</p>
<pre><code> foo: x -&gt; [print ["I'm a lambda" x]]

 &gt;&gt; foo 1020
 I'm a lambda 1020
</code></pre>
<p>This is particularly nice-looking in branching when you want to pass the branch result.</p>
<pre><code>all [
    1 &lt; 2
    3 &lt; 4
    #something
] then x -&gt; [
   print ["X is" mold x]  ; X is #something
]
</code></pre>
<p>The first incarnation used <strong><code>=&gt;</code></strong> as JavaScript did.  But not only is the arrow lighter, it doesn't weigh on the question of whether <strong><code>=&gt;</code></strong> is an "arrow", when <strong><code>&lt;=</code></strong> is not one.  (Debate has been had over whether =&gt; should be a synonym for &gt;=, and =&lt; a synonym for &lt;=, etc. but status quo has won out.)</p>
<p>So <strong><code>&lt;-</code></strong> was targeted as another function generator, namely for doing tacit programming as an alias for POINTFREE.</p>
<pre><code>foo: &lt;- [append [a b c]]

&gt;&gt; foo 'd
== [a b c d]
</code></pre>
<p>The attempt to write POINTFREE entirely in usermode stalled a bit in the face of other priorities, though it's still very much desired.  And it doesn't seem like a bad idea to have &lt;- and -&gt; both connected as fundamental convenient function generators.</p>
<p>I've not really questioned the decision to strike &lt;- as identity until I realized looking at some old code that it really is nice to have some alias for identity, used for one of the annotation purposes I mention.</p>
<p>Backtick is available, though backticks are kind of a blight in general:</p>
<pre><code>browse join
  ` https://github.com/metaeducation/ren-c/blob/master/CHANGES.md#
  ` unspaced [system.version.1 "." system.version.2 "." system.version.3]
</code></pre>
<p>There's a few other ugly options, e.g. backslash which we still haven't given meaning to either.</p>
<pre><code>browse join
  \ https://github.com/metaeducation/ren-c/blob/master/CHANGES.md#
  \ unspaced [system.version.1 "." system.version.2 "." system.version.3]
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Anyway, the cool idea here was just that line continuation not be a scanner feature, but be signaled by means of a normal token that ran the identity function... and you'd be cued into realizing that it was a continuation just because there's no point in calling the identity function in source unless you were applying it like this.</strong></p>
<p>We could throw in a little help by having the evaluator only allow this if it was--actually--an argument to a function.</p>
<p>Based on the above, I'm liking the backtick, and am not sure I'd want heavier for line continuation.</p>
<p>The idea of &lt;- being an alternate way of saying identity that is used for the other annotation purpose (this result is used by the higher up stack level) would then be a possibility.  The system could maybe help a little bit here too, by making sure the <strong>&lt;-</strong> <em>isn't</em> an argument to a function...</p>
<p>POINTFREE would need some other shorthand.  But maybe it's just an alternate mode of LAMBDA.  Or maybe it doesn't really need a shorthand.</p>
<pre><code>foo: ... -&gt; [append [a b c]]

foo: &lt;*&gt; -&gt; [append [a b c]]

foo: |-&gt; [append [a b c]]

foo: -|&gt; [append [a b c]]

foo: pointfree [append [a b c]]

&gt;&gt; foo 'd
== [a b c d]
