    <title>Could Ren-C and Red Interoperate (and if so, *should* they?)</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/could-ren-c-and-red-interoperate-and-if-so-should-they/1787</link>
    <description>When this year can we expect to see full &quot;message passing&quot; inter-operability between Ren-C and Red?

The very basics - MOLD and SAVE are almost in place.

The &quot;binary&quot; equivalent with some form of compatible REBBIN is surely not that hard to agree between the two sets of developers.

Fuller, fluid, message passing - for example the seamless invoking of functions and continuations within a running instance of the other language would be an important demonstration of the REBOL cousins&#39; languages abilities to do what they have stated is a desired characteristic of their respective dialects of REBOL.

This would also harness the strengths of both dialects - for each has been focused these last few years on different arenas. Together, they have the makings of a formidable whole.</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>The term "Ren" (REadable Notation) was an initiative from--I believe--Gregg Irwin and Rebolek, where the idea was to standardize notations between Rebol and Red in a similar way to how JSON was standardized... then allowing other languages (like Python or JavaScript) be able to read the messages as well:</p>
<p><a href="https://pointillistic.com/ren/">https://pointillistic.com/ren/</a></p>
<p>Since that was in the air at the time...and my fork wouldn't/couldn't be called Rebol(tm), the idea was to embrace the idea and call itself "Ren-C" to be the C implementation of that data structure.</p>
<p>That was long ago.  And you won't hear the term "Ren" thrown around by Red much anymore.  And with consensus designs between the projects out the window, it's clear Ren-C is overdue for a name change.  <em>(But you don't get a second chance to make a first impression, so no point in announcing a new name unless there's a bigger announcement to accompany it.)</em></p>
<p>...point of the above being...</p>

<p>...I don't know how close we're going to get on this.</p>
<p>Ren-C hopes to be a <em>kind-of-superset</em>.  So far, the superset is an emulation layer I call "Redbol", and that emulation becomes more difficult as we go along.  (Though I have some ideas.)</p>

<p>I'd say it's very hard if redbin attempts to capture objects and (I think?) binding.  Binding is going to be very different, as summarized in:</p>

<p>I understand feeling there must be some teachable moment to be found on what essence of shared concepts and syntax both Ren-C and Red find so critical as to not throw out.</p>
<p><em>Despite understanding someone having the feeling that should be true...</em> the reality is that interoperability is likely to get worse and not better.  Less will work in the future than works today.</p>
<p>It may be a subset of what could be called "Ren" could be read and written by both.  Important to note is that JSON is typically parsed and not "LOAD"-ed as code even by JavaScript, so similar premises could apply there.</p>
