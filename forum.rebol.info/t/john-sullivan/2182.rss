    <description>Hi!

Love what you all are doing here. I came to know about REBOL from a talk Doug Crockford did on syntax and data formats. I learned more about Carl&#39;s vision for the design and principles of the language, and Ren-C seems to be carrying on that tradition of simplicity and sustainability.

I decided to join the forum because I&#39;ve been craving a language that&#39;s easier to carry with me wherever I might be, and REBOL fits the bill. Excited to learn more from you all.

I&#39;m particularly inspired by @hostilefork&#39;s talk from a few years ago where you could build a new interpreter using [just the tools that come with it](https://youtu.be/PT3GOe1pj9I?si=NJlWjA6r_9i9J5Rh).  I&#39;ve been experimenting recently with the cosmopolitan libc toolchain, and I think it could supercharge that capability:

Admittedly I&#39;m still a novice getting used to everything, but you can try what I have so far here if you&#39;d like:

Building with cosmo allows the executable image to run on just about any computer you can paste it on, no rebuilding required!</description>

<p>Dependency control is still a big motivator...though Ren-C aims to solve fundamental problems of fitness-for-purpose of the language.</p>
<p>This has led to some pretty crazy-seeming inventions, like <strong><a href="https://forum.rebol.info/t/a-justification-of-generalized-isotopes/1918">Generalized Isotopes</a></strong> (including <a href="https://forum.rebol.info/t/taking-action-on-function-vs-action/596/6">antiform FRAME!</a>, which you've already met <img src="https://forum.rebol.info/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20">), <a href="https://forum.rebol.info/t/rebol-and-scopes-well-why-not/1751">whole new ways of looking at binding</a>, and experimental designs for solving problems in really new ways.</p>
<p>So it's kind of an <em>"as simple as possible, but no simpler"</em> situation.  There are those who say Ren-C's inventions aren't necessary...but that's merely because they're willing to blind themselves to just how poor the language is without them.</p>

<p>Glad you liked it!  That demo hasn't been patched up lately due to other priorities.  There is a GitHub Workflow for running the process, though:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/metaeducation/ren-c/blob/master/.github/workflows/linux-tcc-build.yml" class="inline-onebox">ren-c/.github/workflows/linux-tcc-build.yml at master · metaeducation/ren-c · GitHub</a></p>
<p>I'll see if I can get it up to date and working again.</p>

<p>I'd heard of the APE format a while ago.  Sounded like a neat trick.  But at the time there wasn't much of a library, and no X86 on ARM emulator.  Seems to have gotten further along.</p>
<p>Another avenue of attack here are WebAssembly runtimes.  We do have a WASI build:</p>

<p>There's a lot of <em>interestingness</em> to the medium.  It leads you to look at problem solving in a very different way... to kind of "paint with code".  So things other languages would attack with libraries (or mixing the languages you use) you just attack by bending Rebol itself.</p>
<p>I'm not really an evangelist for using Ren-C (or any Redbol) to solve "important" problems, at least not in the current state.  But I do think it's a language family worth knowing, and tackling a little task or two in it is worthwhile.</p>
<p>If that generates enough interest to want to shape the future of it, then I welcome participation in the discussions here!</p>
