    <title>Is The Script Compression Feature Necessary?</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/is-the-script-compression-feature-necessary/2044</link>
    <description>R3-Alpha introduced the option that when you SAVE a script, you can ask that it be compressed.

It doesn&#39;t compress the header...just the body of the script.  There were two options for how this body could be compressed after the header: either as a Base64 BINARY literal (&quot;script compression&quot;), or directly as gzip&#39;d bits (&quot;raw compression&quot;).

As an example:

    &gt;&gt; data: save/compress blank [1 &lt;two&gt; &quot;three&quot;] &#39;script
    == #{
        5245424F4C205B0A202020204F7074696F6E733A205B636F6D70726573735D0A

        724A4B45704E56654943414E425746325951414141417D
    }

    &gt;&gt; print as text! data
    REBOL [
         Options: [compress]
    ]
    64#{H4sIAAAAAAAACjNUsCkpz7dTUCrJKEpNVeICANBWF2YQAAAA}

    &gt;&gt; [body header]: load data
    == [1 &lt;two&gt; &quot;three&quot;
    ]

    &gt;&gt; body
    == [1 &lt;two&gt; &quot;three&quot;
    ]

    &gt;&gt; header
    == make object! [
        Title: &quot;Untitled&quot;
        File: ~null~
        Name: ~null~
        Type: &#39;script
        Version: ~null~

## Rebol2 Didn&#39;t Have It, Red Doesn&#39;t Have It...

Arguments that it helps with transmitting over networks don&#39;t hold up much these days, because the HTTP protocol itself does compression.

Plus, keeping scripts in compressed form is an annoying form of opaqueness on a language that&#39;s supposed to be about simplicity.

I&#39;ve kept it around just because there were tests for it, and it exercised compression code (including showcasing a really bad design method of trying to decompress garbage to see if it was the raw compressed form, causing a crazy memory allocation).  But I&#39;m not sure what the compelling use case for this feature is.</description>
