    <title>Synthesizing Parse Values From Thin Air: JUST</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/synthesizing-parse-values-from-thin-air-just/2328</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve defined **JUST** to synthesize the value after it:

    &gt;&gt; uparse &quot;a&quot; [collect [keep just keep, keep &lt;any&gt;]]
    == [keep &quot;a&quot;]

So it&#39;s acting like this:

    &gt;&gt; uparse &quot;a&quot; [collect [keep (&#39;keep), keep &lt;any&gt;]]
    == [keep &quot;a&quot;]

This can be helpful when you&#39;re trying to build a rule with COMPOSE and the contention over GROUP! and trying to nest inside of it becomes a bummer.

As an example, let&#39;s say you&#39;re trying to build a KEEP parse rule inside a parse rule *(which I am actually at this moment trying to do in the whitespace interpreter project)*:

    name: &quot;Binky&quot;
    uparse ... [... collect [
         keep (compose [keep (to word! name)])
    ] ...]

Okay so that gives you **[keep Binky]**.  Not what you wanted since it will give an error that Binky is not defined.  You can quote it...

    keep (compose [keep &#39;(to word! name)])

Now you&#39;ve got **[keep &#39;Binky]**.  But you&#39;re not trying to match Binky in the input, you&#39;re trying to synthesize it out of thin air.  Imagine we need it in a GROUP!... let&#39;s just go ahead and use the wacky engroup operator to do that:

    keep (compose [keep (engroup quote to word! name)])

So we got our **[keep (&#39;Binky)]**... but that was annoying.  :cloud_with_rain:

Since JUST can literally synthesize a value without matching in parse, we can make something less head-scratchy:

    keep (compose [keep just (to word! name)])

And that gives us **[keep just Binky]** which is much nicer.  The key to seeing why this breaks us out of the problem is that it lets us get at literal values without a GROUP!, which means we aren&#39;t trying to COMPOSE inside of COMPOSE groups.</description>

            <p>I've defined <strong>JUST</strong> to synthesize the value after it:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; uparse "a" [collect [keep just keep, keep &lt;any&gt;]]
== [keep "a"]
</code></pre>
<p>So it's acting like this:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; uparse "a" [collect [keep ('keep), keep &lt;any&gt;]]
== [keep "a"]
</code></pre>
<p>This can be helpful when you're trying to build a rule with COMPOSE and the contention over GROUP! and trying to nest inside of it becomes a bummer.</p>
<p>As an example, let's say you're trying to build a KEEP parse rule inside a parse rule <em>(which I am actually at this moment trying to do in the whitespace interpreter project)</em>:</p>
<pre><code>name: "Binky"
uparse ... [... collect [
     keep (compose [keep (to word! name)])
] ...]
</code></pre>
<p>Okay so that gives you <strong>[keep Binky]</strong>.  Not what you wanted since it will give an error that Binky is not defined.  You can quote it...</p>
<pre><code>keep (compose [keep '(to word! name)])
</code></pre>
<p>Now you've got <strong>[keep 'Binky]</strong>.  But you're not trying to match Binky in the input, you're trying to synthesize it out of thin air.  Imagine we need it in a GROUP!... let's just go ahead and use the wacky engroup operator to do that:</p>
<pre><code>keep (compose [keep (engroup quote to word! name)])
