    <title>Should ANY-VALUE! Include Isotopes?</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/should-any-value-include-isotopes/2026</link>
    <description>So if you don&#39;t put any type restrictions on a parameter, it will allow isotopes:

     &gt;&gt; foo: func [x] [probe x]

    &gt;&gt; foo null
    ~null~  ; isotope

And right now, that is a synonym for ANY-VALUE!.

     &gt;&gt; foo: func [x [any-value!]] [probe x]

    &gt;&gt; foo null
    ~null~  ; isotope

**But what if you want to exclude isotopes?**  We could have a name for the typeset excluding isotopes (perhaps ANY-CELL!).  Or we could say that ANY-VALUE! doesn&#39;t include isotopes by default, and so you have to write **[any-value! isotope!]** if you want them... or just include the specific ones you intend (like **[null! any-value!]**.

Right now I&#39;m going the route of saying ANY-CELL! is the narrower set of values that do not include isotopes.  Is there a better term for saying something can be put into an array vs. not?

*&quot;10 is an integer! which is legal to use as a cell, while ~null~ isotopes are not legal as cells, but can be variable values&quot;*

It seems shorter and cleaner than ANY-REIFIED!  or something like that.  I don&#39;t know any better options.</description>
