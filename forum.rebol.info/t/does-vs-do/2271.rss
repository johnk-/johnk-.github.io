    <title>DOES vs. DO</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/does-vs-do/2271</link>
    <description>Rebol has historically had DOES as the arity-1 function generator, to make a little helper routine you can call, generally inside another function.

    &gt;&gt; name: &quot;Bob&quot;

    &gt;&gt; hello: does [print unspaced [&quot;Hello&quot; _ name &quot;!&quot;]]

    &gt;&gt; hello
    Hello Bob!

I had a &quot;fun&quot; idea at one point, that you could pass DOES anything that DO took:

    &gt;&gt; hello: does https://example.com/print-hello.r

    &gt;&gt; hello
    Hello From The Interwebs!

So basically, DOES was just a specialization of DO.

I actually started tacking on some other behaviors to it, like if it got a WORD! it would fetch that word:

    &gt;&gt; proxy: does $name

    &gt;&gt; proxy
    == &quot;Bob&quot;

But if you&#39;re doing that, it&#39;s something that makes more sense to be done with &quot;accessors&quot;, e.g. **proxy: getter $name** ... because it can be optimized further and you don&#39;t need to use slashes in your calling syntax to get it.

## [But DO of a BLOCK! is Marked For Repurposing](https://forum.rebol.info/t/pushing-the-potential-of-polyglot-polymorphic-do/1846)

So what &quot;DOES&quot; actually wants to do is EVAL the block.

Should it be called EVALUATES now?

    &gt;&gt; name: &quot;Bob&quot;

    &gt;&gt; hello: evaluates [print unspaced [&quot;Hello&quot; _ name &quot;!&quot;]]

    &gt;&gt; hello
    Hello Bob!

Shorthanded as EVALS?

    &gt;&gt; name: &quot;Bob&quot;

    &gt;&gt; hello: evals [print unspaced [&quot;Hello&quot; _ name &quot;!&quot;]]

    &gt;&gt; hello
    Hello Bob!

Or is the disconnect between **DOES** and **DO** not a problem?

What&#39;s a little bit lame is this:

    &gt;&gt; hello: does [do https://example.com/print-hello.r]

I&#39;m not crazy about **`does do`**.  But honestly, that isn&#39;t something that comes up often.

## I Lean To Saying DOES Just Takes A BLOCK! and It&#39;s Fine

I go back and forth on it.  DOES seems brief and familiar.  It can be seen as its own concept, that&#39;s not necessarily in lockstep with DO just because it has the letters D-O in it.

But... when I stop and look at DOES I sort of have a bit of *[Jamais Vu](https://science.howstuffworks.com/life/inside-the-mind/human-brain/jamais-vu.htm)* to where it starts to look like a weirder word than I think it is.  Like it&#39;s deer.  :deer:</description>
