    <title>Getting Output From Rebol2 on Windows GitHub Actions</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/getting-output-from-rebol2-on-windows-github-actions/1966</link>
    <description>For reasons of comparative testing or otherwise, it can be useful to run Rebol2.exe on something like GitHub Actions.  But it&#39;s tricky, since there&#39;s not support for interactivity from &quot;plain&quot; consoles...just the GUI.

* If you use the --nowindow option you can avoid a GUI Window, and then redirect Rebol2&#39;s output to a file.

    * But then you don&#39;t get the output until it finishes--*if* it finishes.

* So the way to get a stream of output into the GitHub Actions log is to use piping.

## But... What Do You Pipe *Into*?

On UNIX you can pipe anything into `cat`, and it will &quot;con-cat-enate&quot; whatever it gets back to the terminal

    $ echo &quot;CAT just repeats&quot; | cat
    CAT just repeats

Windows doesn&#39;t really have an analogue to that, because its seemingly-similar TYPE shell command can&#39;t be piped into.

The trick I came up with offhand was a batch file that pipes into FIND and excludes any line that contains the word &quot;voodoo&quot;:

    # Note: Writing a line from cmd.exe that contains quotes like this is
    # seemingly impossible...escaping with ^&quot; or &quot;&quot; or \&quot; just don&#39;t work.
    # Bash may be ugly, but at least it doesn&#39;t have so many glaring holes.
    #
    - name: Download And Wrap Rebol2 Interpreter
      run: |
        curl -o rebol2-core.exe -L http://www.rebol.com/downloads/v278/rebol-core-278-3-1.exe
        echo &quot;rebol2-core.exe --nowindow %* | find /V \&quot;voodoo\&quot;&quot; &gt; rebol2.bat

So that gives you a Rebol2 command that will behave as you would probably expect something on GitHub Actions to act.

    # See notes above about why Rebol2 is a batch file that does piping.
    #
    - name: Demonstrate Rebol2 Working
      shell: cmd
      run: |
        rebol2 --do &quot;print {Hello from Rebol2 Piping Batch Wrapper}&quot;

Of course these days we can pipe into Ren-C and it can be made to work.  But this is a bit lighter weight.</description>
