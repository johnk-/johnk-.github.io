    <title>REBOL 1 Manual</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/rebol-1-manual/1788</link>
    <description>I was reading about some of the design choices in REBOL, and came upon Joe Marshall&#39;s writings where he talks about the changes between REBOL 1 and 2 (missing continuations, changed scoping rules, absence of tail recursion, etc.). This made me curious about the differences between the two version; however, I can&#39;t find anything related to REBOL 1 on the internet (save for a Scheme compiler).

Will it be possible to share the manual/guide/documentation for REBOL 1 here? It is a piece of history, and it&#39;ll be a shame if it just disappears.</description>

<p><a class="mention" href="/u/gchiu">@gchiu</a> apparently has a printout... perhaps we can scan it and OCR/HTML-ify it.</p>
<p>But given that the Rebol2 manual was pretty light on binding explanation, it might not provide much insight relative to having executables to poke at.</p>

<p>It appears that the documentation was HTML files, but Carl didn't make it so you could click through to them without going through a form until version 2.  Hence <a href="http://archive.org">archive.org</a> couldn't scrape it until then:</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19981212020708/http://rebol.com/">https://web.archive.org/web/19981212020708/http://rebol.com/</a></p>
<p>If it had been a .PDF or something, then someone might have a downloaded a copy and archived it along with the executable.  But I'd guess unless Carl himself has a copy of the source of his old website somewhere, it's gone.</p>
<p>More likely you could find a Rebol 1 executable someone has around.  Though even that might not be as easy to find as one would think.</p>

<p>If you haven't gotten a chance to read my own most recent thoughts on what binding/scoping can or should be:</p>
<p><a href="https://forum.rebol.info/t/rebol-and-scopes-well-why-not/1751" class="inline-onebox">Rebol And Scopes: Well, Why Not?</a></p>
<p>That points to the directions I myself want to keep exploring.  <em>(I've been playing hooky for a couple months and not programming.  But have been taking proactive steps like sending my "work" laptop in for its necessary repairs... and am going to arrange for a place to retreat and design/code for a while.)</em></p>
<p>P.S. Please <a href="https://forum.rebol.info/c/introductions/46">feel free to introduce yourself</a>...</p>
