    <title>Dimensional Analysis with FUSED!</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/dimensional-analysis-with-fused/2239</link>
    <description>[INTEGER!-led FUSED!](https://forum.rebol.info/t/no-interstitial-delimiter-sequence-proposal-fused/1503) could have a pretty good default behavior in addition and subtraction...

    &gt;&gt; 10px + 20px
    == 30px

    &gt;&gt; 10px + 20em
    ** Error: Cannot add FUSED! unless non numeric portions match (px, em)

And with [Backtick Literals](https://forum.rebol.info/t/backtick-literals-and-an-axis-of-extensibility/2235) it might give an answer for the longstanding question of putting units on currency.

    &gt;&gt; `$10.20`USD + `$3.04`CAN
    ** Error: Cannot add FUSED! unless non numeric portions match (USD, CAN)

So we&#39;d get some very limited dimensional analysis.  There&#39;s nothing lower in sequence precedence than a FUSED! though...e.g. FUSED! lives under PATH!, so don&#39;t expect **`10m/s * 20s`** to work.

Although :thinking: you could write **`10[m/s]`** ... but I&#39;m not imagining the built-in multiplication working this out for you.  Just stopping you from adding 10[m/s] to 20s.  But who knows--maybe handling a tiny bit of this would be valuable.

The precedence of TUPLE! beneath PATH! might be an asset here:

    &gt;&gt; x: 10em * 20px
    == 200[em.px]

    &gt;&gt; x / 50
    == 4[em.px/s]

Equality would bite you.  Structurally we can&#39;t say **`4[px.em/s]`** is equal to **`4[em.px/s]`**.  You&#39;d need some kind of canonizing operation that would sort the sequences in a predictable order.  SORT:DEEP ?

    &gt;&gt; sort &#39;f.a:c.d/b.e:[h/g]
    == b.e:[h/g]/f.a:c.d

    &gt;&gt; sort:deep &#39;f.a:c.d/b.e:[h/g]
    == &#39;b.e:[g/h]/a.f:c.d

All integers would have to be less than all WORD!s and LIST!s in sort order to use SORT:DEEP for this purpose.</description>

<p>So we'd get some very limited dimensional analysis.  There's nothing lower in sequence precedence than a FUSED! though...e.g. FUSED! lives under PATH!, so don't expect <strong><code>10m/s * 20s</code></strong> to work.</p>
