    <title>&quot;More arguments for a function on request&quot; (Variadics)</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/more-arguments-for-a-function-on-request-variadics/2174</link>
    <description>On Red&#39;s Gitter, [@GiuseppeChillemi asked](https://matrix.to/#/!EorVRCzrVpjojJtctJ:gitter.im/$9hee8CVtrrHeVB7GTvPmKo2hV04eYAjOrhH64C3j5kY?via=gitter.im&amp;via=matrix.org&amp;via=chat.weho.st):

&gt; Do you think it would be possible to get more arguments for a function on request?
&gt;
&gt; Example:
&gt;
&gt;     aaa: 1
&gt;     bbb: 2
&gt;     ccc: 3
&gt;     f: func [arg1] [other-args: get-args 3]
&gt;     f arg1-val aaa bbb ccc

And Gregg says &quot;oh that would make Red unsafe&quot; (as if Red were somehow &quot;safe&quot;).

Anyway, Ren-C has some support for variadics.  While the implementation hasn&#39;t gotten a lot of attention in a while, it&#39;s no less safe than anything else--the mechanisms used are the same ones that gather ordinary arguments.

     aaa: 1
     bbb: 2
     ccc: 3
     f: func [arg1 others [&lt;variadic&gt; any-value?]] [
         return collect [keep arg1, repeat 3 [keep take others]]
     ]

     &gt;&gt; f 1020 aaa bbb ccc
     == [1020 1 2 3]

The interface is probably not what it&#39;s going to ultimately be.  But for now, you can mark a parameter `&lt;variadic&gt;` and it will be a VARARGS!, that supports TAKE to acquire parameters after the call is made.

Variadics should be used sparingly, because they are difficult to wrap and abstract.  There are some mechanisms for APPLY&#39;ing variadics using a BLOCK! to supply the variadic arguments, but the interface for that is also likely to change.</description>
