    <title>Websocket Support in Oldes Rebol3</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/websocket-support-in-oldes-rebol3/2003</link>
    <description>Looking to see what Oldes has been up to, he added some kind of minimal websocket support to the HTTP scheme:

  https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/bae6cffe97e662ec9a727a01cdcc1fdd61455ea6#diff-490ba807ac4a5ee57e7a587ca0936d36e4c0ff2798b0652fdf791e758ce079c2R718

Websockets isn&#39;t something I&#39;m looking into at this time, but I wanted to bookmark it here in case it comes up later.

He also updated zlib to a new version released in 2022... and [used Ren-C&#39;s %make-zlib.r to do it!](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/commit/15fcc00b84f6d0e386f2ba2f4fc7bdc32ebff75d).  But he edited it so he&#39;d be able to run it under his Rebol3.  It&#39;s not a huge priority to do that update, but seems like since his ported script still worked, it might not be too hard.  (And a good reminder that script exists, and should be part of a CI test...)</description>
