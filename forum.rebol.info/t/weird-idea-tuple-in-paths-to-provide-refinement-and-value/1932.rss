    <title>Weird Idea: TUPLE in Paths to Provide Refinement *AND* Value</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/weird-idea-tuple-in-paths-to-provide-refinement-and-value/1932</link>
    <description>People very frequently request seeing the connection between the refinement and its value more obviously, because the refinement argument is kind of far away:

    &gt;&gt; data: &#39;(a b c)
    &gt;&gt; append/dup data &lt;foo&gt; (1 + 2)
    == (a b c &lt;foo&gt; &lt;foo&gt; &lt;foo&gt;)

So they make broken suggestions like **`append /dup 2 data &lt;foo&gt;`**, which we constantly have to debunk.

Nowadays [we have &quot;APPLY II&quot;](https://forum.rebol.info/t/apply-ii-the-revenge/1834) which helps in more verbose cases:

    &gt;&gt; data: &#39;(a b c)
    &gt;&gt; apply :append [data &lt;foo&gt; /dup (1 + 2)]
    == (a b c &lt;foo&gt; &lt;foo&gt; &lt;foo&gt;)

## But I had an odd idea...

What If You Could Directly Pass A Refinement Arg Via TUPLE?

    &gt;&gt; data: &#39;(a b c)
    &gt;&gt; append/dup.3 data &lt;foo&gt;
    == (a b c &lt;foo&gt; &lt;foo&gt; &lt;foo&gt;)

    &gt;&gt; data: &#39;(a b c)
    &gt;&gt; append/dup.(1 + 2) data &lt;foo&gt;
    == (a b c &lt;foo&gt; &lt;foo&gt; &lt;foo&gt;)

It wouldn&#39;t be great for everything, but it could be convenient.  Not really hard to write, but is it compelling?  Are there other potentially interesting meanings for this notation?</description>
