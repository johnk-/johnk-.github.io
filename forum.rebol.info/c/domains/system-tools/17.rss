          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>There was a Trello card with a remark from <a class="mention" href="/u/johnk">@johnk</a> about an idea from Pekr:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not sure how this would work, but it is an interesting excercise to think about.  Something that bridges between unix and rebol syntax like:</p>
<pre><code>ls | greb 'some alpha ".reb"'
</code></pre>
<p>(assuming a few more built in rules/charsets)</p>
<p>May need a collect/keep kind of wrapper to retrieve data cleanly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This would be a very small subset of what <a class="mention" href="/u/blackattr">@BlackATTR</a>'s QUERY could do...but it seems like it wouldn't hurt if we went ahead and made this program as a test and put it in the <a href="https://github.com/metaeducation/ren-c-stdio">ren-c-stdio</a> repository.</p>
<p>I've already made things like TAC (backwards unix CAT), where the goal is to see how essential and correct we can make things:</p>
<aside class="onebox githubblob">
  <header class="source">
      <a href="https://github.com/metaeducation/ren-c-stdio/blob/7fc17e5bb36ceeb7f688516ba57db5ad84a923c9/tests/tac.r#L19-L21" target="_blank" rel="noopener">github.com</a>
  </header>
  <article class="onebox-body">
    <h4><a href="https://github.com/metaeducation/ren-c-stdio/blob/7fc17e5bb36ceeb7f688516ba57db5ad84a923c9/tests/tac.r#L19-L21" target="_blank" rel="noopener">metaeducation/ren-c-stdio/blob/7fc17e5bb36ceeb7f688516ba57db5ad84a923c9/tests/tac.r#L19-L21</a></h4>
<pre class="onebox"><code class="lang-r"><ol class="start lines" start="19" style="counter-reset: li-counter 18 ;">
<li>write-stdout try delimit/tail newline reverse collect [</li>
<li>    until [not keep line: try read-line]</li>
<li>]</li>
</ol></code></pre>


  </article>
  <div class="onebox-metadata">
    
    
  </div>
  <div style="clear: both"></div>
</aside>

<p><strong>I like the idea of making GREB similarly essential, and part of the samples.</strong>  Worth doing.</p>
<p>(Note that <code>grep</code> was itself originally framed as a one-line <code>awk</code> program.)</p>
<p>I'll also throw in a little ping that it would be nice to have a simple web app that exposed PARSE functionality with some highlighting, like <a href="http://regexpal.com/">http://regexpal.com/</a>.  Seems sometimes we get such big ideas in our head we forget to do the small ones (!)</p>

            <p>Another idea I came up with that can become very useful for system administrators.<br>
To use some applications sometimes you need to establish some connections or a certain setup before they can be started or used.</p>
<p>So for instance to connect to a database a ssh tunnel must be initiated and the program perhaps must be started from a shell script.</p>
<p>Another program will work inside a virtual environment that must be 'activated' first and then a <code>cd</code> to the correct directory.</p>
<p>There could be several other tasks that require one or more terminal windows to be used that could be centralised and managed within Ren-C.</p>
<p>One (other) tool could monitor the status of the different facilities that were managed before.</p>

          <title>Creating a Backup program</title>

            <p>This should be an 'easy' project.<br>
Creating a little piece of backup software using Ren-C.</p>
<p>What should it be able to do?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Connect to a remote backup location</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use a password that will be stored encrypted after it is provided (or not stored and required for every use)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Know which folders to backup</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only backup the files that were changes since last backup on the chosen backup volume</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Preferably have an incremental backup</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is not primarily meant for backing up sourcecode, because git and other svn systems are taking that role already. It is for other documentation and stuff that hangs around on your computer and would be nice to recover after machine loss or transfer to a new one.</p>

<p>Needs touching up and will do that once I get some spare time.</p>
