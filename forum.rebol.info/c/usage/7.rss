          <title>Getting an unset variable</title>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Trash (now anti BLANK!) <a href="https://forum.rebol.info/t/shades-of-distinction-in-non-valued-intents/1604">has been established</a> as the value of unset variables. As the example in that thread states:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-plaintext">&gt;&gt; trash-value
** Error: TRASH-VALUE variable is unset

&gt;&gt; append [a b] get/any 'trash-value
** Error: APPEND does not allow adding ~ antiforms to blocks
</code></pre>
<p>But when I try this, I get quite different results:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-plaintext">&gt;&gt; trash-value
** Script Error: trash-value word is attached to a context, but unassigned

&gt;&gt; append [a b] get/any 'trash-value
** Script Error: trash-value word is not bound to a context
</code></pre>
<p>In fact, even GET/ANY doesn’t seem to work… even when I make sure the binding is right:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-plaintext">&gt;&gt; get/any 'trash-value
** Script Error: trash-value word is not bound to a context

&gt;&gt; get/any $trash-value             
** Script Error: trash-value word is attached to a context, but unassigned
</code></pre>
<p>So, what’s happening here? And how <em>do</em> I get trash out of an unset variable?</p>

<p>Void is used generically in many places when you want things to vanish:</p>

<p>Ah-ha… I’d completely missed this use of void, as a return value.</p>
<p>Though this does now raise the question of whether a function should return nihil or void. Both seem to vaporise in lists, after all. I guess it depends on whether you want the function call to be ignored or not.</p>

<p>(If I may philosophise for a moment… I feel there’s a big, gaping hole in my understanding of how we decide ‘what Rebol syntax is’, so to speak. Perhaps my caution around sigils and TYPE-BLOCK!s are a manifestation of that hole, as is this. I’ll make a new thread about it if I can figure out any clearer way to articulate my concerns.)</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>This is that thread.</p>
<p>I’ll begin by observing that in Rebol, the complexity of the lexer vs the parser is ‘reversed’ compared to other programming languages. In Rebol, the actual syntax is highly minimalistic: there’s only a few constructs which provide explicit grouping, and none provide anything more than a simple list of items. By contrast, the lexer is exceedingly complicated: nearly every datatype has its own literal form, oftentimes more than one.</p>
<p>Language design ends up ‘reversed’ in a similar way. In most languages, discussion centres around questions like ‘which new syntactic constructs should we add’. By contrast, Rebol (and especially Ren-C) more often poses the question: ‘which new datatypes do we want to include, with which literal syntax?’.</p>
<p>At the moment, I still feel uncomfortable discussing such questions. I don’t feel that I fully understand the kind of criteria we should consider to know whether a datatype is worth including or not. Or, more concisely, I don’t understand how decide: <strong>what deserves to be a Ren-C datatype?</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<p>One obvious criterion is simply, <em>datatypes representing common types of data</em>. This is why we have things like MONEY! and FILE! and DATE! and so on. Ultimately this stems from Rebol’s heritage as a data-transfer format, but obviously these types are far more broadly useful.</p>
<p>Another obvious criterion is <em>syntax which is important for programming</em>. This gives us GROUP! and GET-WORD! and PATH! and so on. These exist as datatypes ultimately because Rebol is homoiconic, but their presence has suggested a wide range of uses beyond simple programming.</p>
<p>This accounts for most of the types in Ren-C. And, if that were all to it, I’d have no objections.</p>
<hr>
<p>But, unfortunately, there are some other types, whose presence is explained by neither of those criteria. As I’ve said previously, the ones which make me feel most uncomfortable are THE-* and TYPE-*. Neither of these represent common types of data that one would want to pass around. And, with the possible exceptions of THE-WORD! and TYPE-BLOCK!, they’re basically useless in ‘regular’ programming.</p>
<p>Despite this, <a class="mention" href="https://forum.rebol.info/u/hostilefork">@hostilefork</a> has lobbied pretty hard for both of these. Hopefully it should be clear now why I find this viewpoint confusing. I can’t say the existence of these types is <em>problematic</em>, as such, but I feel this <strong>indicates a gap in my understanding of the language</strong>.</p>
<p>The closest to an explanation I’ve found is that these types are useful in dialecting. That is, they may not be useful for programming <em>per se</em>, but having the syntax around is useful for constructing new languages. (For instance, using TYPE-WORD!s in PARSE dialect, or THE-WORD!s for module inclusion.) The problem with this is, <a href="https://forum.rebol.info/t/a-proliferation-of-word-s/2147">as we’ve established</a>, that there’s a huge number of syntaxes which would be ‘useful in dialecting’: clearly, this is too low a bar for deciding ‘what deserves to be a datatype’.</p>
<p>(And, incidentally, this also establishes that we’re quite willing to reject datatypes that don’t seem to be of sufficiently general usage.)</p>
<p>Another argument is simply consistency: other sigils have versions for words, blocks, tuples, etc., so THE-* and TYPE-* should as well. But this doesn’t strike me as particularly convincing — there’s nothing intrinsic in Ren-C which requires sigils to generalise to all possible types. Indeed, we’re quite willing to avoid doing so when it would make no sense. (For instance, we don’t have ISSUE-TEXT!, ISSUE-BINARY!, ISSUE-EMAIL!… we just have a single textual ISSUE! type, because doing otherwise would be silly.)</p>
<p>So, when all is said and done, we have a set of types which don’t seem to be of general use, and have no convincing reason to exist, but are nonetheless kept in the language. And <strong>I want to know why that is</strong>, because I can’t figure it out.</p>

          <title>REIFY and DEGRADE: a Narrower META and UNMETA</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[hostilefork]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Feature Discover</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>In the "small improvements can be big" category, I think that I've settled on the name for the function that turns quasiforms into antiforms, but leaves everything else alone: <strong>DEGRADE</strong>...and its complement <strong>REIFY</strong> which turns antiforms into quasiforms (but leaves everything else alone).</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; first [1020 ~null~]
== 1020

&gt;&gt; second [1020 ~null~]
== ~null~

&gt;&gt; degrade first [1020 ~null~]
== 1020

&gt;&gt; degrade second [1020 ~null~]
== ~null~  ; anti

&gt;&gt; 304
== 304

&gt;&gt; reify 304
== 304

&gt;&gt; true
== ~true~  ; anti

&gt;&gt; reify true
== ~true~
</code></pre>
<p>If you're dealing with a full-band situation where you genuinely don't know if you're working with a "meaningful quasiform" where <em>quasi means quasi</em>, you have to use META and UNMETA.  But if you know that quasiforms aren't part of your data of interest, REIFY and DEGRADE can help you dodge adding and removing quote marks much (or most) of the time.</p>

<p>Maybe it would be better (and give Chris less of a heart attack) if it said:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-plaintext">for-each [sigil' items] [
    ~null~ [  word   tu.p.le   pa/th   [bl o ck]   (gr o up)  ]
    '::    [  word:  tu.p.le:  pa/th:  [bl o ck]:  (gr o up): ]
    ':     [ :word  :tu.p.le  :pa/th  :[bl o ck]  :(gr o up)  ]
    '^     [ ^word  ^tu.p.le  ^pa/th  ^[bl o ck]  ^(gr o up)  ]
    '&amp;     [ &amp;word  &amp;tu.p.le  &amp;pa/th  &amp;[bl o ck]  &amp;(gr o up)  ]
    '@     [ @word  @tu.p.le  @pa/th  @[bl o ck]  @(gr o up)  ]
    '$     [ $word  $tu.p.le  $pa/th  $[bl o ck]  $(gr o up)  ]

      for-each item items [
          if (unmeta sigil') &lt;&gt; sigil of item [fail [mold item]]
      ]
 ]
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I like how DEGRADE can be used in situations like this to help you strike the quotes on the normal values...since SIGIL OF never returns quasiforms, only SIGIL! or a null antiform:</p>
<pre><code>for-each [sigil items] [
    ~null~ [  word   tu.p.le   pa/th   [bl o ck]   (gr o up)  ]
    ::     [  word:  tu.p.le:  pa/th:  [bl o ck]:  (gr o up): ]
    :      [ :word  :tu.p.le  :pa/th  :[bl o ck]  :(gr o up)  ]
    ^      [ ^word  ^tu.p.le  ^pa/th  ^[bl o ck]  ^(gr o up)  ]
    &amp;      [ &amp;word  &amp;tu.p.le  &amp;pa/th  &amp;[bl o ck]  &amp;(gr o up)  ]
    @      [ @word  @tu.p.le  @pa/th  @[bl o ck]  @(gr o up)  ]
    $      [ $word  $tu.p.le  $pa/th  $[bl o ck]  $(gr o up)  ]
][
    for-each item items [
        if (degrade sigil) &lt;&gt; sigil of item [
            fail [mold item]
        ]
    ]
]
</code></pre>
<p>I think this will be a useful and common pattern.</p>
<p>Void being a word antiform is locking this all up into place!</p>

          <title>Fundamental distinguishing features of Rebol</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[bradrn]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Philosophy</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Perhaps foolishly, I offered to give a talk at my local Functional Programming meetup next month. Given my recent interests, I’m thinking of giving an intro to Rebol and its basic concepts.</p>
<p>So that’s gotten me thinking: what <em>are</em> the basic concepts of Rebol as a programming paradigm, which distinguish it from all others? Here’s what I’ve come up with so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Everything is a datatype</strong>: Rebol was built for networking. This means you should be able to take any value, serialise it in a human-readable way, and parse it back into a value. This means a lot of built-in datatypes for useful concepts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data is code</strong>: Everything starts out its life as data. If you want, you can evaluate it in some way to get a result. Naturally, you can evaluate it using any rules you want, which gives you <strong>dialecting</strong> as a corollary.</p>
<p>(It’s worth noting that this is the converse of Lisp’s famous maxim, ‘code is data’.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Binding</strong>: Word values are associated with their storage. This can be arbitrarily manipulated by the programmer, leading to <strong>definitional scoping</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More generally, I might summarise all the above points as natural consequences of <strong>computing with evaluation</strong>: the fundamental operation of Rebol is taking values and extracting some kind of result from them. This necessitates the other points above: a rich set of datatypes to store both the original value and the result, the ability to treat those datatypes as code which can be evaluated, and a way to look up references during the evaluation process.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Does this all seem reasonable? Have I missed anything?</p>

          <title>Reacting to Definitional Errors: CURTAIL</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[hostilefork]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Show &amp; Tell</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Here's a simple <a href="https://forum.rebol.info/t/introducing-reframer-close-cousin-to-enclose/1395">REFRAMER</a> called CURTAIL:</p>
<pre><code>curtail: reframer function [frame [frame!]] [
    return do frame except e -&gt; [
        if e.id == 'need-non-null [return void]
        raise e
    ]
]
</code></pre>
<p>If you don't remember what reframers do, they just have access to a function call before you run it.  Here we are looking for the function we're running to give us a NEED-NON-NULL error.</p>
<p><em>But we're not looking for just any NEED-NON-NULL error that might go by.</em>  We're only interested in ones that are coming out of the call we're processing.  If that happens, we just vaporize the expression.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; compose [(null)]
** Script Error: non-NULL value required (see MAYBE, TRY, REIFY)

&gt;&gt; curtail compose [(null)]  ; will give back void
</code></pre>
<p>You can see something like this simplifying null checks:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; ver: 1.2.3
&gt;&gt; date: null

&gt;&gt; print [curtail spaced ["Version:" ver] curtail spaced ["Date:" date]]
Version: 1.2.3
</code></pre>
<p><em>But like I said, it's not just any NEED-NON-NULL...</em></p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; a: 1 b: null c: 3
&gt;&gt; get-ver: func [] [to tuple! reduce [a b c]]

&gt;&gt; print [curtail spaced ["Version:" get-ver] curtail spaced ["Date:" date]]
** Script Error: non-NULL value required (see MAYBE, TRY, REIFY)

            <p>I recently discovered a version of COLLECT by Brett Handley (for R2) that is less general <em>[<a href="https://forum.rebol.info/t/implementing-collect-keep/2099">than what COLLECT has been come to be known as</a>]</em> but avoids nested code.</p>
<pre><code>collect: func [
    {Collects block evaluations, use as body in For, Repeat, etc.}
    block [block!] "Block to evaluate."
    /initial result [series! datatype!] "Initialise the result."
    /only "Inserts into result using Only refinement."
] [
    if not initial [result: block!]
    result: any [all [datatype? result make result 1000] result]
    reduce ['head pick [insert insert/only] not only 'tail result to paren! block]
]
</code></pre>
<p>Examples (running in Rebol2 interpreter):</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; for i 1 10 2 collect [i * 10]
== [10 30 50 70 90]
    
&gt;&gt; foreach [a b] [1 2 3 4] collect [a + b]
== [3 7]

&gt;&gt; foreach w [a b c d] collect [w]
== [a b c d]

&gt;&gt; repeat e [a b c %.txt] collect/initial [e] %file
== %fileabc.txt

&gt;&gt; iota: func [n [integer!]][repeat i n collect/initial [i] make block! n]
&gt;&gt; iota 10
== [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10]

<p>Features based on string interpolation are so undeniably useful that once the possibilities are seen, they can't be unseen.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Honestly, I’m not sure I agree with this. In Haskell, which is my main language, there are packages which implement string interpolation… and no-one uses them, because they just aren’t necessary! It’s no big deal when it’s easier to just concatenate stuff together.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>To pick a random example from the build helpers for "CScape" interpolation of some generated C code:</p>
<pre><code>emit {
    #define ${MAYBE PREFIX}INCLUDE_PARAMS_OF_${NATIVE-NAME} \
        $[Items]; \
        assert(Get_Series_Info(level_-&gt;varlist, HOLD))
}
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The use of <code>${}</code> (instead of <code>$()</code> or <code>$&lt;&gt;</code>) means that the result of the expression should be <a href="https://github.com/metaeducation/ren-c/blob/815758fb571e88591908dc94f9320581f00d9331/tools/common.r#L37">turned into a valid C identifier name</a>... so dashes are converted to underscores, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The use of all capitals in the <code>${}</code> escaping means that the strings generated by the expressions evaluated should be made all uppercase.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The use of <code>$[]</code> means that items is an array, and its elements should be printed one line at a time...repeating the boilerplate leading and trailing on each line (in this case an indent on the left, and a semicolon and backslash on the right)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The template looks something like the result:</p>
<pre><code>#define INCLUDE_PARAMS_OF_IF \
    DECLARE_PARAM(1, return); \
    USED(ARG(return)); \
    DECLARE_PARAM(2, condition); \
    DECLARE_PARAM(3, branch); \
    assert(Get_Series_Info(level_-&gt;varlist, HOLD))
</code></pre>
<p>Without interpolation, we fall back on LOAD-able code... where spaces and quotes are required by the language itself.  This starts to lose the ability to keep track of actual spaces in the interpolated thing, plus you keep having to start and stop string delimiters on the string portions.</p>
<p>I'm not quite sure how it would come together dialected via regular code, but it would drift away from looking like C code, at best it might look like:</p>
<pre><code>emit [
    "#define " &lt;c&gt; (MAYBE PREFIX) "INCLUDE_PARAMS_OF_" &lt;c&gt; (NATIVE-NAME) " \"
    "    " @[Items] "; \"
    "    assert(Get_Series_Info(level_-&gt;varlist, HOLD))"
]
</code></pre>
<p><em>I'd be hard-pressed to say the spacing was correct on inspection</em>.  We've lost the intuition about where the unspaced parts are.  You can imagine it getting worse when you're building unspaced material inside a string literal.  Strings can simply be the least noisy medium when you want to see something that looks close to the result.</p>
<p>Anyway, with strings carrying binding, we wouldn't have to do what we do today... which is actually pass the variables (that don't live in LIB) in a block to emit:</p>
<pre><code>emit [prefix native-name items] {  ; &lt;-- ack
    #define ${MAYBE PREFIX}INCLUDE_PARAMS_OF_${NATIVE-NAME} \
        $[Items]; \
        assert(Get_Series_Info(level_-&gt;varlist, HOLD))
}
</code></pre>
<p>So I look forward to getting rid of that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And it’s even easier in Rebol than it is in Haskell, because there’s already a single built-in function to do everything for you:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; x: 10 y: "foo"
== "foo"
&gt;&gt; print ajoin ["Scopes? " x " " x " " x " " y " " y " " y]
Scopes? 10 10 10 foo foo foo
&gt;&gt; foo: func [x] [local: 20 ajoin ["The sum is " (x + local)]]
&gt;&gt; foo 30
== "The sum is 50"
</code></pre>
<p>I strongly prefer this approach over string concatenation, since by using sensible data structures it integrates much better with the rest of the language. (It also reduces the risk of errors from malformed strings, and potentially the equivalent of SQL injection attacks.)</p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Ren-C offers an alternative to historical AJOIN and REJOIN called DELIMIT:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; delimit "," ["foo" 1 + 2 "bar"]
== "foo,3,bar"

&gt;&gt; delimit/head "," ["foo" 1 + 2 "bar"]
== ",foo,3,bar"

&gt;&gt; delimit/tail "," ["foo" 1 + 2 "bar"]
== "foo,3,bar,"

&gt;&gt; delimit/head/tail "," ["foo" 1 + 2 "bar"]
== ",foo,3,bar,"
</code></pre>
<p>If you don't want it to reduce, you can use an @ block:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; delimit "," @["foo" 1 + 2 "bar"]
== "foo,1,+,2,bar"
</code></pre>
<p>SPACED and UNSPACED are specializations, running through the same code for stringifying any non-string contents.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; spaced ["foo" 1 + 2 "bar"]
== "foo 3 bar"

&gt;&gt; unspaced ["foo" 1 + 2 "bar"]
== "foo3bar"
</code></pre>
<p>PRINT uses SPACED internally when you pass it a block.  You can use <strong>print unspaced</strong> to pass it a string if you want unspaced intent.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; print ["foo" 1 + 2 "bar"]
foo 3 bar

&gt;&gt; print unspaced ["foo" 1 + 2 "bar"]
foo3bar
</code></pre>
<p>If you use a character (like <span class="hashtag">#a</span>) instead of a string (like "a"), the delimiting won't be applied.  For instance, a newline won't leave spaces on either end of the line break:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; spaced ["foo" 1 + 2 newline "bar"]
== "foo 3^/bar"
</code></pre>
<p>NULLs will trigger errors, VOIDs will vanish.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; spaced ["foo" if false [1 + 2] "bar"]
== "foo bar"

&gt;&gt; spaced ["foo" pick [a b] 3 "bar"]
** Script Error: non-NULL value required (see MAYBE, TRY, REIFY)

&gt;&gt; spaced ["foo" maybe pick [a b] 3 "bar"]
== "foo bar"

          <title>Implementing COLLECT + KEEP</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[hostilefork]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Show &amp; Tell</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>COLLECT allows you to build up a block, without needing to name the block or pass it as a parameter to individual APPEND instructions.  Instead you use KEEP, which appends to the implicit nameless block:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; collect [
       keep 'foo:
       print "Arbitrary code possible"
       keep/line [1 2 3]
       keep spread [Spread #works @(T O O)]
       repeat 2 [keep &lt;whatever&gt;]
    ]
Arbitrary code possible
== [
    foo: [1 2 3]
    Spread #works @(T O O) &lt;whatever&gt; &lt;whatever&gt;]
</code></pre>
<h2>
<a name="leverages-lambda-to-bind-keep-to-code-1" class="anchor" href="https://forum.rebol.info#leverages-lambda-to-bind-keep-to-code-1"></a>Leverages LAMBDA To Bind KEEP To Code</h2>
<p>The trick is that the body is turned into a function that takes KEEP as a parameter.  This defines the word KEEP for the body.</p>
<p>To see how this works, imagine this:</p>
<pre><code>collector: lambda [keep [action?]] [
    keep 'foo:
    print "Arbitrary code possible"
    keep/line [1 2 3]
    keep spread [Spread #works @(T O O)]
    repeat 2 [keep &lt;whatever&gt;]
 ]

 block: copy []
 keeper: specialize :append [series: block]

 collector :keeper
</code></pre>
<p>This code gets the desired result in BLOCK.</p>
<h2>
<a name="slight-twist-make-keep-return-its-input-2" class="anchor" href="https://forum.rebol.info#slight-twist-make-keep-return-its-input-2"></a>Slight Twist: Make KEEP Return Its Input</h2>
<p>APPEND will return the block that you append to.  This would reveal the partially-built temporary block before the collect is complete.  A better and more useful result of KEEP would be to return the value that you pass it.</p>
<p>To accomplish that, we can ENCLOSE the specialization:</p>
<pre><code>keeper: enclose (specialize :append [series: block]) func [f [frame!]] [
    let value: f.value
    do f
    return value
]
</code></pre>
<p>We have to capture the value to append before we DO the captured FRAME!, because Rebol functions are permitted to make arbitrary modifications to their arguments during execution.  <em>(To help avoid mistakes, you are not allowed to read a frame's values after a DO is complete.)</em>  It's possible to DO COPY F but that makes a copy of the entire frame, and here we just copy the value we want.</p>
<p>A more efficient way to do this is to use a LAMBDA for the wrapper function, and ELIDE the DO.  There's no need to type check F (since ENCLOSE only passes the FRAME! built for APPEND, never anything else):</p>
<pre><code>keeper: enclose (specialize :append [series: block]) lambda [f] [
    f.value
    elide do f  ; evaluates to anti-isotope of 0 length block, vanishes
]
</code></pre>
<h2>
<a name="putting-it-together-3" class="anchor" href="https://forum.rebol.info#putting-it-together-3"></a>Putting It Together</h2>
<p>Wrapping this up for a working COLLECT implementation:</p>
<pre><code>collect: func [
    return: [block!]
    body [block!]
][
    let block: copy []
    let keeper: enclose (specialize :append [series: block]) lambda [f] [
        f.value
        elide do f
    ]
    run (lambda [keep] body) :keeper
    return block
]
</code></pre>
<p>It's a good demonstration of how you can make something impressive that feels like a first-class language feature out of Rebol, with little effort.</p>

          <title>Which isotopes are currently in use?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[bradrn]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Questions</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Since <a href="https://forum.rebol.info/t/a-justification-of-generalized-isotopes/1918">generalised isotopes</a>, every type has an isotopic form which cannot be stored in blocks. But not every isotopic type makes sense — for instance, what could one do with an isotopic TIME!? So it seems that, out of necessity, practical uses for isotopic values are decided on an ad-hoc basis.</p>
<p>So far, the ones I know about are these:</p>
<ul>
<li>Isotopic GROUP!s are splices, which are pretty trivial to understand</li>
<li>Isotopic FRAME!s are actions, which run themselves when invoked (though in that case I don’t quite get what non-isotopic FRAME!s would be)</li>
<li>Isotopic VOID! is an unset variable, I believe, though the naming seems to have changed so often that I’ve had a lot of trouble following the relevant forum posts</li>
<li>Isotopic COMMA! is… <a href="https://forum.rebol.info/t/the-language-worlds-weirdest-comma-mechanic/1387/6">something</a>… which acts as an expression barrier somehow (though similarly to FRAME! I have trouble distinguishing this from the non-isotopic COMMA!)</li>
<li>Isotopic WORD!s seem to be error states of some description, as well as booleans — except that makes no sense to me, since surely booleans should be storable in blocks‽</li>
<li>I’ve seen a few references to an isotopic NIHIL, but I don’t know what that does nor what a non-isotopic NIHIL would be</li>
</ul>
<p>So… clearly there’s a lot missing. Do we have any comprehensive list of which of the various isotopic types are currently in use, and what they are used for? If not, it would be awfully convenient to have one…</p>

          <title>Why Have Both BLOCK! and GROUP!</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[bradrn]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Questions</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Maybe this is a stupid question, but here’s something I’ve been wondering about Rebol: since quoting exists, block!s feel a bit redundant. Something like <code>[a b c]</code> could just as easily be represented as <code>the (a b c)</code>. So, why do both exist?</p>
<p>Or, to put it another way, it feels like Rebol has two orthogonal concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grouping: you can take a bunch of symbols and parenthesize them to get a group!</li>
<li>Quoting: you can take a value and quote it to prevent evaluation</li>
</ul>
<p>So it makes sense that you can combine these: <code>the (a b c)</code>. Except that Rebol doesn’t seem to take advantage of this fact at all — rather, it goes the opposite route, by creating a new data structure which conflates aspects of both of these.</p>

            <p>While writing tests for the QUERY dialect against some sample files in a directory, it ran into an issue of the order those files were given back.  <em>Operating system APIs generally do not return the list of files in a determined order, and the ordering across filesystems also varies.</em></p>
<p>This means that even with the same files, you could have the lists come back differently.  One OS could say:</p>
<pre><code>Domain-SQL&gt;&gt; select 'name 'date from %tests/file-tests/
    where 'size &gt; 100 and 'date = 26-Jul-2021

1 [%tests/file-tests/Disk50.txt 26-Jul-2021]
2 [%tests/file-tests/11barz99.txt 26-Jul-2021]
3 [%tests/file-tests/Apple3.txt 26-Jul-2021]
4 [%tests/file-tests/Banana1.txt 26-Jul-2021]
5 [%tests/file-tests/BANANA22.txt 26-Jul-2021]
...
</code></pre>
<p>While another would say:</p>
<pre><code>Domain-SQL&gt;&gt; select 'name 'date from %tests/file-tests/
    where 'size &gt; 100 and 'date = 26-Jul-2021

1 [%tests/file-tests/Apple3.txt 26-Jul-2021]
2 [%tests/file-tests/Banana1.txt 26-Jul-2021]
3 [%tests/file-tests/BANANA22.txt 26-Jul-2021]
4 [%tests/file-tests/Disk50.txt 26-Jul-2021]
5 [%tests/file-tests/11barz99.txt 26-Jul-2021]
...
</code></pre>
<p>This made getting reproducible outputs to verify was hard.</p>

<p>Getting determinism in the output meant using a function that guarantees an ordering for filenames:</p>
<pre><code>Domain-SQL&gt;&gt; select 'name 'date from %tests/file-tests/
    where 'size &gt; 100 and 'date = 26-Jul-2021

4 [%tests/file-tests/Banana1.txt 26-Jul-2021]
5 [%tests/file-tests/Disk50.txt 26-Jul-2021]
...
</code></pre>
<p>Having to pay for the sort adds a little bit of overhead, but it's not that significant.</p>

<p>WASI in WebAssembly is looking to chase down sources of non-determinism and see what it can do to stop it.  They mention directory listing order as one potential for problems:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI/issues/190" class="inline-onebox">Roadmap to determinism in WASI · Issue #190 · WebAssembly/WASI · GitHub</a></p>
<p>They seem to believe that on the same OS the directory ordering would be deterministic for the same files, but I don't know of any guarantee of that.</p>

<p>We can pick many examples... like whether a MAP! will always enumerate in the same order on different platforms, or with the same contents.  Using a deterministically sorted implementation of map would seem to have a number of advantages.</p>
<p>Especially since there's a growing push in software for giving deterministic outputs by default.  If you want some reasoning, see this article:</p>

          <title>COMPOSE of TUPLE! and PATH! (and toplevel GROUP!)</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[hostilefork]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Feature Discover</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>While working on <a class="mention" href="https://forum.rebol.info/u/blackattr">@BlackATTR</a>'s query, I noticed code that was making paths (now tuples) out of components via TO TUPLE! COMPOSE of a BLOCK!.  Like this:</p>
<pre><code>to tuple! compose [obj clauses (kwd.1)]
</code></pre>
<p>But did you know that COMPOSE can act directly on TUPLE! and PATH!  You could instead just write:</p>
<pre><code>compose 'obj.clauses.(kwd.1)
</code></pre>
<p>It supports splices as well:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; compose '(10 + 20)/a/b/(spread [c d e])/(reverse [g f])
== 30/a/b/c/d/e/[f g]
</code></pre>
<p>And if you remember that TUPLE! can be nested underneath PATH! (not vice versa) then you can COMPOSE/DEEP and handle mixed tuples and paths:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; compose/deep '(10 + 20)/a/b.(spread [c d e])
== 30/a/b.c.d.e
</code></pre>
<p>Voids can vanish...so there can be fewer dots in an output tuple than in the input:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; compose 'a.(if false [b]).c
== a.c
</code></pre>
<p>Empty splices will vanish as well:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; compose 'a.(spread []).c
== a.c
</code></pre>
<p>You can't compose in NULLs as an important safety measure...central to the design!</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; compose 'a.(select [x 10 y 20] 'b).c
** Script Error: non-NULL value required (see MAYBE, TRY, REIFY)
** Near: [a ** (select [x 10 y 20] 'b) c]
</code></pre>
<p>But don't forget about MAYBE as the way to convert nulls to void when that's what you meant!</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; compose 'a.(maybe select [x 10 y 20] 'b).c
== a.c
</code></pre>
<h2>
<a name="you-can-also-compose-a-group-1" class="anchor" href="https://forum.rebol.info#you-can-also-compose-a-group-1"></a>You can also COMPOSE a GROUP!</h2>
<p>In R3-Alpha, only BLOCK! would compose.  Everything else was passed-through as-is, including GROUP!s (PAREN!s in their terminology)</p>
<pre><code>r3-alpha&gt;&gt; compose quote (1 + (2 + 3))
== (1 + (2 + 3))
</code></pre>
<p>Red just doesn't allow it:</p>
<pre><code>red&gt;&gt; compose quote (1 + (2 + 3))
*** Script Error: compose does not allow paren! for its value argument
</code></pre>
<p>So you'd wind up having to make BLOCK!s and then convert them:</p>
<pre><code>red&gt;&gt; as paren! compose [1 + (2 + 3)]
== (1 + 5)
</code></pre>
<p>But in Ren-C, group composing works... it just leaves the top group as-is.  And you also have quoted groups to make it easier!</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; compose '(1 + (2 + 3))
== (1 + 5)
</code></pre>

          <title>Skinning REPLACE with Red&#39;s String PARSE Hack</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[hostilefork]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Show &amp; Tell</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Red made an unusual choice with their implementation of REPLACE when you use a pattern that's a block with a string.  Instead of trying to stringify the block, <a href="https://github.com/red/red/blob/40096dd12ca9c3b9b47e9eaa995d425b9faf620b/tests/source/units/replace-test.red#L72">they assume it's a PARSE rule</a>:</p>
<pre><code>red&gt;&gt; replace/case/all "aAbbabAAAa" ["Ab" | "Aa"] "-"
== "a-babAA-"
</code></pre>
<p>It seems like a bad idea to make the choice to do this based on the input type.  What if you actually want to do this when the input is a BLOCK!?  I'd prefer something like <strong>parse-replace</strong> <em>(or if we ever allow the same word to be a function and a module, maybe <strong>parse.replace</strong>)</em>.</p>
<p>But honestly, I think that the answer is just to keep pushing on UPARSE itself to be slick enough that you wouldn't feel the need to reach for a shorthand like this.  It's pretty easy to write as is:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; parse/case "aAbbabAAAa" [
       try some thru [change ["Ab" | "Aa"] ("-")]
       accept &lt;input&gt;
   ]
== "a-babAA-"
</code></pre>
<p>That's probably reaching the limits of how short UPARSE can do an equivalent.  Yet it's more powerful if you want to deviate or customize it, so I would reach for this more often than a limited REPLACE.</p>

<p>So you should be able to adapt REPLACE to have Red's behavior if you want it.</p>
<p>Super easy.  Barely an inconvenience!</p>
<pre><code>replace: enclose :lib.replace func [
     f [frame!]
     &lt;local&gt; head tail rule
][
    if not all [
        match [text! binary!] f.target
        block? f.pattern
    ][
        return do f  ; use normal REPLACE semantics
    ]

    rule: if activation? :f.replacement '[  ; function generates replacement
        head: &lt;here&gt;
        change [f.pattern, tail: &lt;here&gt;] (
            apply/relax :f.replacement [const head, const tail]
        )
    ] else '[  ; replacement can be used as-is
        change f.pattern (f.replacement)
    ]

    apply :parse [/case f.case, f.target [
        while [thru rule] (
            if not f.all [return f.target]
        )
        to &lt;end&gt;
    ]]
    return f.target
]
</code></pre>

<a name="it-worked-the-first-time-i-ran-it-2" class="anchor" href="https://forum.rebol.info#it-worked-the-first-time-i-ran-it-2"></a>It worked the first time I ran it!</h2>
<p>There's so much interesting stuff going on here that it's hard to list it all. I can quickly hit some high points.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You don't have to repeat the interface of REPLACE.  This is an ENCLOSE, so it just passes the frame built for LIB.REPLACE to the wrapper and lets it choose whether to run that frame as-is (or modified), or do its entirely own thing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It uses the <a href="https://forum.rebol.info/t/the-cool-new-repurposing-of-while-in-parse/1875">kickass new arity-2 WHILE combinator</a> to great effect...simply iterating over the replacement rule.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://forum.rebol.info/t/apply-ii-the-revenge/1834">Modern kickass APPLY</a> for PARSE lets you put arguments in any order, and does refinements by name... here we put /CASE first because it's clearer... then passing the series and the rule.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It doesn't just run isotopic actions if they are passed, but it also optionally passes them the head and tail of where in the input is matched.  If the function is arity-1, it just receives the head.  If it's arity-0, it doesn't receive either.  (This is due to APPLY's /RELAX that tolerates too many arguments.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I wrote a little demo of the fancier function invocation:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; data: "(real)1020(powerful)0304(magic)"

&gt;&gt; collect [
       replace/all data [between "(" ")"] func [head tail] [
            let item: copy/part head tail
            keep item
            if item = "(powerful)" [item: copy "(ren-c)"]
            return uppercase item
        ]
    ]
== ["(real)" "(powerful)" "(magic)"]

&gt;&gt; data
== "(REAL)1020(REN-C)0304(MAGIC)"
</code></pre>
<p>Not only that, but the references to the head and tail of the match are CONST...which prevents the replacement function from messing up the in-progress iteration of the series where the replace is happening.  It only achieves modification by means of what result it synthesizes.</p>
<p>How about that?</p>

          <title>Working With Truthy BLANK! (in SPLIT-PATH Tests)</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[hostilefork]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Show &amp; Tell</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>The current re-imagining of the concept of truthy/falsey involves the idea that <em>anything you can put into a block is truthy</em>.  That includes BLANK!.</p>
<p>~null~ isotopes are falsey, and will REIFY to be <strong><code>~null~</code></strong> which can be somewhat clumsy-looking.</p>
<p>But consider some test cases for seeing how SPLIT-PATH works, looking a bit like this:</p>
<pre><code>split-path-tests:  [
    %foo                            [_ %foo]
    %/c/test/test2                  [%/c/test/ %test2]
    %/c/test                        [%/c/ %test]
    %//test                         [%// %test]
    %/test                          [%/ %test]
    %//                             [%// _]
    %./                             [%./ _]
    &lt;...etc...&gt;
]
</code></pre>
<p>SPLIT-PATH is a multi-return routine, which gives back two values: the path and the filename.  But if one or the other is missing then that component will be null, which is useful for testing with IF (or using DEFAULT with).</p>
<p>But if we just blindly changed the tests to reify, it would become less legible:</p>
<pre><code>split-path-tests:  [
    %foo                            [~null~ %foo]
    %/c/test/test2                  [%/c/test/ %test2]
    %/c/test                        [%/c/ %test]
    %//test                         [%// %test]
    %/test                          [%/ %test]
    %//                             [%// ~null~]
    %./                             [%./ ~null~]
    &lt;...etc...&gt;
]
</code></pre>
<p>However...with blanks being truthy, this means you that you can take a variable which may be null and turn it into a blank, like this:</p>
<pre><code>reduce [any [path _] any [file _]]
</code></pre>
<p>That's rather succinct!  Probably so succinct that it doesn't need its own native to express.</p>
<p>(I thought it was neat.)</p>

          <title>Jonathan Blow, and Euclid&#39;s Elements</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[hostilefork]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Philosophy</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Jonathan Blow is a video game developer--who made a well known indie game called "Braid" that did some fun time/space manipulations people generally hadn't seen before in a Mario-type platfomer.   Later he took a number of years to make the much higher-budget art piece The Witness...a very intellectual game which has a Sixth-Sense kind of reveal that's quite good.</p>
<p>Though as time changes him from grumpy indie upstart to grumpy-old-man, he has joined the chorus of us grumpy old men when it comes to complexity:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pW-SOdj4Kkk">Jonathan Blow - Preventing the Collapse of Civilization (English only)</a></p>

<p>But I'm pretty sure he would pretty much hate Redbol languages for programming his games.  He doesn't like scripting, and thinks it's dumb to use things without static typing or that catch your mistakes in advance.  (And I'm with him when he responds to people who say things like "but you can try changes without restarting" are wrongheaded.  You can compile checked bits of code and reload them dynamically if your system is designed right.)</p>
<p>What he's looking for is something that offers the benefits of C++ and Rust, but minus the things he considers to be annoying.  "Something like Rust, but cutting out anything that would be an impediment to the games that I--Jonathan Blow--would write."</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/BSVino/JaiPrimer/blob/master/JaiPrimer.md" class="inline-onebox">JaiPrimer/JaiPrimer.md at master · BSVino/JaiPrimer · GitHub</a></p>
<p>I imagine that if Jonathan <em>were</em> to appreciate something like Ren-C it would be in the way I do--as a game in itself.  (He actually playtested "Baba is You"--according to a YouTube stream of him playing the final version.  When asked what he was paid to give his feedback he just grumbled "not enough".  So I probably won't be sending Ren-C to him.  :-P)</p>
<p>In any case, he was doing a talk on games in education and cited a page from Euclid's Elements that I thought was interesting.  <a href="https://youtu.be/qWFScmtiC44?t=756">The quote he cites says</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"If a first magnitude has to a second the same ratio as a third has to a fourth, and also a fifth has to the second the same ratio as a sixth to a fourth, then the sum of the first and fifth has to the second the same ratio as the sum of the third and sixth has to the fourth."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm sure it sounded like nonsense to Euclid's contemporaries, who were not able (or willing) to follow the reasoning for why such things might be important.</p>
<p>When you're reasoning through new abstract things there's lots of phases to it.  Terminology and mechanics evolve over time.  That's how it works, so people shouldn't be surprised to see things like <em><a href="https://forum.rebol.info/t/the-implications-of-meta-producing-quasi-from-isotopes/1967">"The Implications of ^META Producing QUASI! from Isotopes"</a></em>  <img src="https://forum.rebol.info/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Rebol was an attempt at grappling with the problems of overly complex and bloated software.  Part of that means not wasting RAM or CPU cycles.</p>
<p>Optimizing is just a normal part of software development. It's not done to please the programmer, but to build something of quality that respects the user who is running other pieces of software that are also using resources.  Think of it as being a good computational neighbor.</p>
<p>There needs to be some thread here about "computing horror stories". A month ago there was an article on Hacker News about NixOS and it's packaging system.  As some Nix user had just contacted me about packaging xu4, I thought I'd give it a spin.  After downloading the ISO and installing it on a virtual machine I went to get a package listing...<br>
and was greeted with some vague error message.</p>
<p>It turns out that the package manager was using well over 1GB of RAM and simply crapped out because my VM didn't have enough.  Some NixOS user told me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Listing all packages is a bit of a weak spot. The entire package set is described in a lazy, functional language and listing or searching it requires evaluating the entire thing."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is an entire OS custom built around a package manager, and it couldn't even give me a listing of my packages.  The Nix developers want to geek out about their language, but I just want tools that work.</p>
<p>Thankfully, data-oriented design is now a thing, so I know at least someone is paying attention.</p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Here's is R3-Alpha's <a href="https://github.com/rebol/rebol/blob/25033f897b2bd466068d7663563cd3ff64740b94/src/mezz/prot-http.r">PARSE-WRITE-DIALECT</a> from %prot-http.r</p>
<pre><code>parse-write-dialect: func [port block /local spec] [
    spec: port/spec
    parse block [
        [set block word! (spec/method: block) | (spec/method: 'post)]
        opt [set block [file! | url!] (spec/path: block)]
        [set block block! (spec/headers: block) | (spec/headers: [])]
        [set block [any-string! | binary!] (spec/content: block) | (spec/content: none)]
    ]
]
</code></pre>
<p>You couldn't set paths in R3-Alpha parse, which is weird.  So things had to be captured into a temporary variable (it reused the input block for some reason).</p>
<p>Let's imagine that setting paths were legal:</p>
<pre><code>parse-write-dialect: func [port block /local spec] [
    spec: port/spec
    parse block [
        [set spec/method word! | (spec/method: 'post)]
        opt [set spec/path [file! | url!]]
        [set spec/headers block! | (spec/headers: [])]
        [set spec/content [any-string! | binary!] | (spec/content: none)]
    ]
]
</code></pre>
<p>Let's do a quick transformation of this to PARSE3 in Ren-C, where the keyword TRY now replaces OPT:</p>
<pre><code>parse-write-dialect: func [port block &lt;local&gt; spec] [
    spec: port.spec
    parse3 block [  ; PARSE3 is R3-Alpha-compatible parse
        [set spec.method word! | (spec.method: 'post)]
        try [set spec.path [file! | url!]]
        [set spec.headers block! | (spec.headers: [])]
        [set spec.content [any-string! | binary!] | (spec.content: null)]
    ]
]
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The TUPLE!s help us see we're not making function calls, which is nice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>/LOCAL is a legitimate normal refinement, and <code>&lt;local&gt;</code> variables are truly local--you can't slip them in from the caller.  Because they are invisible, you can build function compositions that don't have to worry about colliding with their names.</p>
<ul>
<li>It also frees up /LOCAL to just be a typical refinement, like TIME/LOCAL</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now let's throw in some UPARSE, with the SET-WORD!s for assignment...</p>
<pre><code>parse-write-dialect: func [port block &lt;local&gt; spec] [
    spec: port.spec
    parse block [  ; PARSE is now UPARSE
        [spec.method: word! | (spec.method: 'post)]
        try [spec.path: [file! | url!]]
        [spec.headers: block! | (spec.headers: [])]
        [spec.content: [any-string! | binary!] | (spec.content: null)]
    ]
]
</code></pre>
<p>It looks a little tighter...but then we also have the ability to factor the assignments out.  And as it happens, that last line could just be <strong>try [any-string! | binary!]</strong>, because TRY would assign the result to NULL if it can't match:</p>
<pre><code>parse-write-dialect: func [port block &lt;local&gt; spec] [
    spec: port.spec
    parse block [
        spec.method: [word! | ('post)]
        spec.path: try [file! | url!]
        spec.headers: [block! | ([])]
        spec.content: try [any-string! | binary!]
    ]
]
</code></pre>

          <title>Weird Little Function: STEAL a Variable&#39;s Prior Value</title>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I don't know if it has the best name (suggestions?), but it's kind of interesting...</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; x: 304
== 304

&gt;&gt; steal x: 1000 + 20
== 304

&gt;&gt; x
== 1020
</code></pre>
<p>I wrote it as a variadic function for some reason (as a test, maybe?) but you could write it in Redbol.  You could even use their lame ALSO.</p>
<pre><code>steal: func [
    {Red version}
    'var [set-word! set-path!]
    value [any-type!]
][
    also get var set var value
]
</code></pre>
<p>The Ren-C version of that reads a lot better:</p>
<pre><code>steal: lambda [
    {Ren-C version}
    'var [set-word! set-path!]
    value [any-value!]
][
    get var
    elide set var value
]
</code></pre>
<p>It naturally has the benefit of letting you break things across lines.  I feel like it's better to point out "this is the thing being erased".  And of course the mechanic is far more general.</p>
<p>I definitely like ANY-VALUE! better than ANY-TYPE!.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm sure I've seen places I could have used it if I thought of it.  I'll keep my eyes open.</p>

          <title>A Justification of Generalized Isotopes</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[hostilefork]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Philosophy</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p><em>Here is a train of thought to help people realize why isotopes are needed, and why unifying their behaviors and mechanisms under a common umbrella makes sense.  It starts from the issue of solving /ONLY and then explains the generalization.</em></p>
<p><em>As time permits, I'll come back and try to improve this...</em></p>
<p><em>NOTE: Terminology has changed over time to where what was once called "the isotopic form" of a value is now called "the antiform", in order to be more consistent with the meaning of the word isotope as describing a group of forms in other fields.  You may see lingering references to the old usage.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Years of fretting over the /ONLY debacle converged on a somewhat inescapable conclusion:</p>
<p><em><strong>It's better to carry the intent of whether a value needs to be spliced on that value...as opposed to having subtle variants of core operations that modulate the splicing.</strong></em></p>
<p>I'd worked up to a point where I was implementing the "mark of intent" by adding a quoting level to <em>suppress</em> splicing.  Yet this faced likely accidents when someone had a quoted value in a variable...and really meant to use it somewhere as-is, with the quote--vs. thinking of the quote as a splice-suppression signal which the operation should remove.</p>
<p>Then <a href="https://forum.rebol.info/t/putting-splicing-intent-on-appended-value/1873/9">@rgchris made this remark</a>:</p>

</div>
<blockquote>
<p>The issue I have with doing the opposite of ONLY—let's call it SPREAD—is what is the interim value?</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; block: [a b c [a b c]]

&gt;&gt; find block pick block 4
[[a b c]]

&gt;&gt; find block spread pick block 4
[a b c [a b c]]

&gt;&gt; spread pick block 4
???
</code></pre>
<p>It would seem to have virtue over ONLY and is a better word.</p>

<p>As a rough first cut, let's represent splices with a specially recognizable 2-element wrapper block.  We'll signal it's a splice with a series in the first slot--checking for the unique identity of that series.  Then put the block itself as the second element:</p>
<pre><code>splice-cue: "!!!splice!!!"

spread: func [block [block!]] [
    return reduce [splice-cue block]
]

splice?: func [value] [
    if not block? :value [return false]
    return same? splice-cue first value
]
</code></pre>
<p>Then we can write our new versions of things like APPEND that are specifically aware of this construct.</p>
<pre><code>append*: func [series [series!] value] [
    return either splice? :value [
        append series second value
    ][
        append/only series :value
    ]
 ]
</code></pre>
<p>It works more or less in your average Redbol, e.g. in Red:</p>
<pre><code>red&gt;&gt; append* [a b c] spread [d e]
== [a b c d e]

red&gt;&gt; append* [a b c] [d e]
== [a b c [d e]]

red&gt;&gt; append* [a b c] 'd
== [a b c d]

red&gt;&gt; append* [a b c] first ['d]
== [a b c 'd]
</code></pre>
<p><em>In fact, this is essentially how the bootstrap executable for Ren-C simulates the SPREAD behavior.</em></p>
<p>But the weaknesses are <em>immediately</em> apparent!!!  <img src="https://forum.rebol.info/images/emoji/twitter/pouting_cat.png?v=12" title=":pouting_cat:" class="emoji" alt=":pouting_cat:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>

<p>There's no special type for the spliced block...it's just a BLOCK!.  This means any routine that hasn't been written to handle it, will just let it leak through.</p>
<pre><code>red&gt;&gt; reduce [spread [a b c] [a b c]]
== [["!!!splice!!!" [a b c]] [a b c]]  ; not [a b c [a b c]]
</code></pre>
<p>Changing to some other generic type that can contain a block...such as an OBJECT!...doesn't help matters.  You are kind of in trouble any time an operation willfully lets you put these into an array.</p>
<p><strong>The first instinct might be to introduce a new SPLICE! datatype, with a system-wide rule that splices can't be put into arrays.</strong>  <em>(Enforcing such a rule across all array-manipulating code is challenging...so let's sort of make a note of that fact, but continue.)</em></p>
<p>Because of the peculiar nature of not being able to be put in a block, there'd have to be a decision made about function arguments as to whether or not they took this type.  Many functions designed to handle generic values would not be able to handle them, so there'd presumably need to be some typeset like ANY-NOTSPLICE! or ANY-NORMAL!.</p>

<p>Now we've got several things to ponder about our new type.  For instance: what you should see here?</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; obj: make object! [foo: spread [d e]]
== make object! [
    foo: ???
]
</code></pre>
<p>We just said that a defining feature of SPLICE! is that you can't accidentally put them in blocks.  But the argument to MAKE OBJECT!, namely <strong><code>[foo: ???]</code></strong>, is a block.  If <code>???</code> can't itself be a splice!, then what is it?</p>
<p>This brings up a possibly-related question: what if you want a way to put the intent of whether to splice or not into "suspended animation?"... in a way that you could collect it?</p>
<p>Here's a sort of contrived example of the puzzle:</p>
<pre><code>generate: func [n [integer!]] [
   if even? n [return reduce [n n + 1]]
   return spread reduce [n n + 1]
]

wrap: func [
    return: [...]
    in [splice! block!]
][
    ...
]

unwrap: func [
    return: [splice! block!]
    wrapped [...]
][
    ...
]

n: 0
pending: collect [while [n &lt; 4] [keep wrap generate n]]

data: copy []
for-each item pending [append data unwrap item]
</code></pre>
<p>How would you write WRAP and UNWRAP such that at the end of the code above, you'd get:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; data
== [[0 1] 1 2 [2 3] 3 4]
</code></pre>
<p>If the system didn't provide some answer to this, you'd end up needing to re-invent something kind of equivalent to the primitive <code>["!!!splice!!!" [...]]</code> mechanic as a means of persistence:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; pending
== [[0 1] ["!!!splice!!!" [1 2]] [2 3] ["!!!splice!!!" [3 4]]]

<h1>
<a name="isotopes-were-designed-for-this-4" class="anchor" href="https://forum.rebol.info#isotopes-were-designed-for-this-4"></a>Isotopes Were Designed For This!</h1>
<p>Isotopes are a set of curated answers for these problems.  Originally they were introduced to address issues like what an UNSET! was...which has some of the same class of problems as SPLICE! (such as not wanting to be put in BLOCK!s, and not accepted by default or by most routines).</p>
<p>Isotopes introduce two new variants of datatypes called <em>antiforms</em> and <em>quasiforms</em>.  Antiforms cannot be put in blocks.</p>
<p>Isotopes are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>general</strong> - all base value types (e.g. unquoted things) can have antiforms and quasiforms</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>efficient</strong> - antiforms and quasiforms do not require allocations, and merely are a different state of a byte in the value cell (the same byte that encodes quoting levels)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"meta-representable"</strong> - all antiforms can be produced by evaluating their quasiforms, and quasiforms can be produced by evaluating quoted quasiforms.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I mentioned at the outset that it would be somewhat costly to bulletproof all of native code against the ability to do something like append a specific data type like "SPLICE!" to a block.  But with isotopes this problem has been solved once for all the forms...so the same code that prevents a so-called "UNSET!" from winding up in arrays works for splices.  <em>That's because a splice is actually a group! antiform, and an unset variables actually hold BLANK! antiforms!</em></p>
<p>Above I asked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What you should see here?</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; obj: make object! [foo: spread [d e]]
== make object! [
    foo: ???
]
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Isotopes give us the answer, that it's <strong><code>foo: ~(d e)~</code></strong>.  This is the previously mentioned "QUASIFORM!" of GROUP!, which when evaluated produces an antiform of GROUP!...which by convention represents a splice.</p>
<p><em>But antiforms themselves have no canon representation.</em>  The console can print out a comment or show them in a different color, but to talk about them having a representation doesn't make much sense as you'll never see them in source.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; ~(d e)~
== ~(d e)~  ; anti
</code></pre>
<p>I also asked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"How would you write WRAP and UNWRAP such that at the end of the code above, you'd get:"</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; data
== [[0 1] 1 2 [2 3] 3 4]
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>With group antiforms representing splices, you don't need to write WRAP and UNWRAP... because these operations are built in operations called META and UNMETA.  And the pending array would look like:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; pending
== ['[0 1] ~(1 2)~ '[2 3] ~(3 4)~]
</code></pre>
<p>When the QUOTED! blocks are UNMETA'd, they become regular blocks and then are appended as-is.  When the QUASIFORM! groups are UNMETA'd they become antiforms and give the splice intent.  This produces the desired "suspended animation" to preserve the intent.</p>
<p><em>That suspended animation is also used in the ^META parameter convention, which indicates a function argument can accept arbitrary antiforms... and the add-quoting-or-quasi behavior brings those antiform variables into a reified state so they can be safely handled.</em></p>
<h2>
<a name="the-proof-is-in-the-capabilities-5" class="anchor" href="https://forum.rebol.info#the-proof-is-in-the-capabilities-5"></a>The Proof Is In The Capabilities</h2>
<p>I've explained about splices, and mentioned how it crosses needs with unset variable states.</p>
<p>But it's also <a href="https://forum.rebol.info/t/shades-of-distinction-in-non-valued-intents/1604">how NULL and VOID are implemented</a>, as antiforms of WORD! states that can't be put in blocks.</p>
<p>The ERROR! antiform is used to have a sneaky out-of-band way to return <a href="https://forum.rebol.info/t/fail-vs-return-fail-the-new-age-of-definitional-failures/1852">definitional errors</a></p>
<p>The FRAME! antiform is what we'd traditionally think of as an "ACTION!" or "FUNCTION!".  It triggers execution if accessed via WORD! references.  This makes it safe to handle items picked out of blocks without worrying about defusing actions...because only quasiform or plain frames can be put in blocks in the first place!</p>
<p>It's natural for there to be some confusion with the new idea--especially given all its churn through the course of design.  But the design is becoming clearer, and I think people are going to find this gives solidity to writing complicated but coherent code...vastly outpacing historical Redbol.</p>

            <h2>The Imaginary 3-D Dungeon Simulator of the Year, 1983...</h2>
<p>NOW ON THE WEB!!</p>

<h2>Backstory</h2>
<p>When I was a kid (circa 1983, I'd be about 8 or 9), I played the Intellivision game <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Dungeons_&amp;_Dragons:_Treasure_of_Tarmin">Advanced Dungeons and Dragons: Treasure of Tarmin</a>. The 3-D graphics put you in a first-person-perspective point of view with shocking realism:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/X4aGT.png" alt="Shockingly Realistic 3-D Graphics" width="320" height="200"></p>
<p>But a year or two later, I got a C-64. And I was able to draw on the 40x25 character grid by cursoring around the screen, setting the color with the Ctrl key and a digit, and putting symbols anywhere I wanted <em>(why doesn't <code>bash</code> let me do that?)</em>. The character set had triangular components and solid block components.</p>
<p></p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://forum.rebol.info/uploads/default/original/1X/0d0d338da02ccf2e47f3427a3ffc08fddfbfb7a4.jpeg" data-download-href="https://forum.rebol.info/uploads/default/0d0d338da02ccf2e47f3427a3ffc08fddfbfb7a4" title="image"><img src="https://forum.rebol.info/uploads/default/optimized/1X/0d0d338da02ccf2e47f3427a3ffc08fddfbfb7a4_2_252x250.jpeg" alt="image" data-base62-sha1="1Rsurb7Q0aQ1IugNlN0VbFjgToE" width="252" height="250" srcset="https://forum.rebol.info/uploads/default/optimized/1X/0d0d338da02ccf2e47f3427a3ffc08fddfbfb7a4_2_252x250.jpeg, https://forum.rebol.info/uploads/default/optimized/1X/0d0d338da02ccf2e47f3427a3ffc08fddfbfb7a4_2_378x375.jpeg 1.5x, https://forum.rebol.info/uploads/default/optimized/1X/0d0d338da02ccf2e47f3427a3ffc08fddfbfb7a4_2_504x500.jpeg 2x" data-small-upload="https://forum.rebol.info/uploads/default/optimized/1X/0d0d338da02ccf2e47f3427a3ffc08fddfbfb7a4_2_10x10.png"></a></div><p></p>
<p>So I was able to reason through how one might generate a rendering of one's perspective in a grid through that medium.</p>
<p>In 2013, I found the nearly-three-decades-old spec, in spiral-bound notebook paper, about "Dungeon Construction Set":</p>
<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WHYpo.jpg" alt="enter image description here" width="320" height="320"></p>
<p><em>(Careful readers will notice that while it's almost right, this doesn't quite hold together on the slanted parts...)</em></p>
<p>Though Treasure of Tarmin was played on a grid, the walls existed only on the <em>edges</em> of grid squares. Having learned what bytes were, I realized that if I made the map out of bytes...then each square on the map could have four possible states for each of its edges:</p>
<ol>
<li>Unobstructed</li>
<li>Wall</li>
<li>Door</li>
<li>Something Else?</li>
</ol>
<p>The design allows for the opportunity that adjacent cells would "disagree"...e.g. have a wall on one side and a door on the other.  I considered this a feature; these situations would give rise to one-way doors and walls that didn't appear until you passed through them and then turned around.</p>
<p>My idea was that a position on the map and a direction you were facing could "light up" regions on the screen...a bit like lighting up segments of a digit on an LCD.</p>
<p>But an implementation of the ideas eluded me.  It was a trickier program than I had written at the time, made even trickier because I was trying to implement it in a "machine language monitor".  I had no assembler, and the book I read didn't discuss them...just the instruction set and workings of the 6502 chip.</p>
<p>(The machine-language-monitor programs could encode single instructions into specific memory locations.  But unlike an assembler, it had no labels or other abstractions...all addresses had to be kept track of on paper.)</p>
<p>By the time I knew enough about programming that I could do something like this in an evening, I no longer cared much about the idea.  But better late than never, right?</p>
<p>Although Unicode/ASCII don't have good "seamless drawing" characters to do this like the C-64 could, it can still get the idea across.</p>
<h2><a href="https://github.com/red/red/pull/612">Originally Wrote this in Red (2013)</a></h2>
<p>I decided I'd use this relatively simple task as something where I would use Red the whole time--as opposed to writing it in Rebol2 or R3-Alpha and then porting the differences.  So that let me get a sense of where the pain points were regarding things like syntax error reporting, that sort of stuff.</p>
<p>Anyway, about a decade later, it's now a Ren-C sample.  Minor modifications were made, including taking advantage of the ReplPad's CLEAR-SCREEN ability (if running on the web).</p>

            <p>I was looking at this from the emscripten config file:</p>
<pre><code> ; Right now, either #web or #node (someday #wasm-edge ?)
 ;
 javascript-environment: #web
</code></pre>
<p>And I thought to myself: well that's kind of ugly.  The comment is having to list things that would be more obviously shown by just demonstrating the options:</p>
<pre><code>javascript-environment: circled [(#web) #node]
</code></pre>
<p>It could default to NULL if you circled nothing, but you could use MUST to suggest people needed to select something:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; number: must circled [#one #two #three]
** Error: MUST requires argument not to be NULL
</code></pre>
<h2>
<a name="its-almost-too-easy-1" class="anchor" href="https://forum.rebol.info#its-almost-too-easy-1"></a>It's Almost <em>Too</em> Easy</h2>
<p>When it's this easy, who wouldn't whip such things up?</p>
<pre><code>circled: lambda [block [block!] &lt;local&gt; result] [
    parse block [
        result: try thru subparse group! [
            &lt;any&gt; &lt;end&gt; | (fail "Circled Items Must Be Singular")
        ]
        try [thru group! (fail "Only One Circle")]
        accept (result)
    ]
]

&gt;&gt; circled [a (b) c]
== b

&gt;&gt; circled [a b c]
; null

&gt;&gt; circled [a (b c)]
** Error: Circled Items Must Be Singular

&gt;&gt; circled [(a) b (c)]
** Error: Only One Circle
</code></pre>
<p>Remarkable plasticity, and I want to see these weapons come to the code golfing field <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDKaz1iB9wQ">once they are adequately Rebmooshed</a>.  <img src="https://forum.rebol.info/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
<hr>
<p>This example tipped the balance to where I decided that matching <strong><code>&lt;end&gt;</code></strong> should be invisible.  Because I wanted a way to synthesize the result while doing the end match.  Writing <strong><code>elide &lt;end&gt;</code></strong> is possible, but there's essentially no cases in practice where you don't want to elide the end.</p>
<pre><code> &gt;&gt; parse [1 2] ['1 &lt;end&gt; | (fail "Not a 1 followed by the end")]
 ** Error: Not a 1 followed by the end

 &gt;&gt; parse [1] ['1 &lt;end&gt; | (fail "Not a 1 followed by the end")]
 == 1
</code></pre>
<p>The previous result was evaluating the <code>&lt;end&gt;</code> to the input position at that moment of being at the end--so effectively a series at its tail:</p>
<pre><code> &gt;&gt; parse [1] ['1 &lt;end&gt;]
 == []  ; old behavior...how often would you want this?
</code></pre>
<p>If that's what you actually want (which no one ever did) you can can say <strong><code>&lt;end&gt; &lt;here&gt;</code></strong>.</p>
<pre><code> &gt;&gt; parse [1] ['1 &lt;end&gt; &lt;here&gt;]
 == []
</code></pre>
