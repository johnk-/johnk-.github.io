<blockquote>
<p><strong><code>&lt;/&gt;</code></strong> is a TAG!</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>This strikes me as being odd. It’s not a valid closing tag in HTML or XML, for instance. I find it natural to interpret this as ‘path from <code>&lt;</code> to <code>&gt;</code>’.</p>

          <title>&quot;More arguments for a function on request&quot; (Variadics)</title>

            <p>On Red's Gitter, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/!EorVRCzrVpjojJtctJ:gitter.im/$9hee8CVtrrHeVB7GTvPmKo2hV04eYAjOrhH64C3j5kY?via=gitter.im&amp;via=matrix.org&amp;via=chat.weho.st">@GiuseppeChillemi asked</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you think it would be possible to get more arguments for a function on request?</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>aaa: 1
bbb: 2
ccc: 3
f: func [arg1] [other-args: get-args 3]
f arg1-val aaa bbb ccc
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>And Gregg says "oh that would make Red unsafe" (as if Red were somehow "safe").</p>
<p>Anyway, Ren-C has some support for variadics.  While the implementation hasn't gotten a lot of attention in a while, it's no less safe than anything else--the mechanisms used are the same ones that gather ordinary arguments.</p>
<pre><code> aaa: 1
 bbb: 2
 ccc: 3
 f: func [arg1 others [&lt;variadic&gt; any-value?]] [
     return collect [keep arg1, repeat 3 [keep take others]]
 ]

 &gt;&gt; f 1020 aaa bbb ccc
 == [1020 1 2 3]
</code></pre>
<p>The interface is probably not what it's going to ultimately be.  But for now, you can mark a parameter <code>&lt;variadic&gt;</code> and it will be a VARARGS!, that supports TAKE to acquire parameters after the call is made.</p>
<p>Variadics should be used sparingly, because they are difficult to wrap and abstract.  There are some mechanisms for APPLY'ing variadics using a BLOCK! to supply the variadic arguments, but the interface for that is also likely to change.</p>

          <title>Getting an unset variable</title>

            <p>Nothing (now anti BLANK!) <a href="https://forum.rebol.info/t/shades-of-distinction-in-non-valued-intents/1604">has been established</a> as the value of unset variables. As the example in that thread states:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-plaintext">&gt;&gt; nothing-value
** Error: NOTHING-VALUE variable is unset

&gt;&gt; append [a b] get/any 'nothing-value
** Error: APPEND does not allow adding ~ antiforms to blocks
</code></pre>
<p>But when I try this, I get quite different results:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-plaintext">&gt;&gt; nothing-value
** Script Error: nothing-value word is attached to a context, but unassigned

&gt;&gt; append [a b] get/any 'nothing-value
** Script Error: nothing-value word is not bound to a context
</code></pre>
<p>In fact, even GET/ANY doesn’t seem to work… even when I make sure the binding is right:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-plaintext">&gt;&gt; get/any 'nothing-value
** Script Error: nothing-value word is not bound to a context

&gt;&gt; get/any $nothing-value             
** Script Error: nothing-value word is attached to a context, but unassigned
</code></pre>
<p>So, what’s happening here? And how <em>do</em> I get nothing out of an unset variable?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Void is used generically in many places when you want things to vanish:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-plaintext">&gt;&gt; compose [&lt;a&gt; (if false [&lt;b&gt;]) &lt;c&gt;]
== [&lt;a&gt; &lt;c&gt;]
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Ah-ha… I’d completely missed this use of void, as a return value.</p>
<p>Though this does now raise the question of whether a function should return nihil or void. Both seem to vaporise in lists, after all. I guess it depends on whether you want the function call to be ignored or not.</p>

            <pre><code>&gt;&gt; type of 1

<p>I would have expected this to print as <code>integer!</code>, since that’s how we refer to it in discussions. But no, it prints with an ampersand. I’m sure there’s some good reason for this, but the apparent inconsistency is jarring.</p>

          <title>Which antiforms are currently in use?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[bradrn]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Questions</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Since <a href="https://forum.rebol.info/t/a-justification-of-generalized-isotopes/1918">generalised isotopes</a>, every type has an antiform which cannot be stored in blocks. But not every antiform type makes sense — for instance, what could one do with an antiform TIME!? So it seems that, out of necessity, practical uses for antiform values are decided on an ad-hoc basis.</p>
<p>So far, the ones I know about are these:</p>
<ul>
<li>Antiform GROUP!s are splices, which are pretty trivial to understand</li>
<li>Antiform FRAME!s are actions, which run themselves when invoked (though in that case I don’t quite get what non-antiform FRAME!s would be)</li>
<li>Antiform VOID! is an unset variable, I believe, though the naming seems to have changed so often that I’ve had a lot of trouble following the relevant forum posts</li>
<li>Antiform COMMA! is… <a href="https://forum.rebol.info/t/the-language-worlds-weirdest-comma-mechanic/1387/6">something</a>… which acts as an expression barrier somehow (though similarly to FRAME! I have trouble distinguishing this from the non-antiform COMMA!)</li>
<li>Antiform WORD!s seem to be error states of some description, as well as booleans — except that makes no sense to me, since surely booleans should be storable in blocks‽</li>
<li>I’ve seen a few references to an antiform NIHIL, but I don’t know what that does nor what a non-antiform NIHIL would be</li>
</ul>
<p>So… clearly there’s a lot missing. Do we have any comprehensive list of which of the various antiforms are currently in use, and what they are used for? If not, it would be awfully convenient to have one…</p>

          <title>Why Have Both BLOCK! and GROUP!</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[bradrn]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Questions</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Maybe this is a stupid question, but here’s something I’ve been wondering about Rebol: since quoting exists, block!s feel a bit redundant. Something like <code>[a b c]</code> could just as easily be represented as <code>the (a b c)</code>. So, why do both exist?</p>
<p>Or, to put it another way, it feels like Rebol has two orthogonal concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grouping: you can take a bunch of symbols and parenthesize them to get a group!</li>
<li>Quoting: you can take a value and quote it to prevent evaluation</li>
</ul>
<p>So it makes sense that you can combine these: <code>the (a b c)</code>. Except that Rebol doesn’t seem to take advantage of this fact at all — rather, it goes the opposite route, by creating a new data structure which conflates aspects of both of these.</p>

          <title>My Summary of the Big Picture</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[hostilefork]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Questions</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I wrote this to someone in a GitHub issue and thought it was pretty salient:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What has drawn people to Rebol historically has varied. But a large number who praised it and used it were less interested in the language itself, rather the properties of the executable. It was small, and you could run on any OS without installing anything else...it came with a GUI built in.</p>
<p>But when serious language theorists look at Rebol, they notice it is riddled with design holes. The language itself wasn't <em>composable</em> the way one might like languages to be: mixing constructs in new ways that weren't specifically accounted for never worked. It was more like a "scriptable app" that had a few features that pleased its userbase...and had to be extended by the designer every time a new need came up.</p>
<p>So put briefly: If you don't understand what these holes are, then you won't appreciate the many issues that Ren-C is trying to solve.</p>
<p>Once you know that historical Rebol was fundamentally broken, there are basically 3 choices:</p>
<ol>
<li>Inventory and address the holes one at a time and try to fix or mitigate them</li>
<li>Ignore the holes and just hope that if you add enough features and integration no one will notice</li>
<li>Turn away and run from the crackpots using it, and work with a more solidly designed language</li>
</ol>
<p>(1) is Ren-C's hard-chosen path. Energy is spent on identifying certain patterns in source that users <em>must</em> be able to write and have work, if the language is to justify its existence at all. While it would be nice if stack traces were beautiful and if building the sources was 100% easy, all of that would be meaningless if the punch line was <em>"oh, and the language this is all supporting doesn't actually work"</em></p>
<p>(2) is chosen by people like Red and <a href="https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3">Oldes's branch of R3-Alpha</a>, as well as some clones that have popped up over the years. Starting from scratch inevitably makes the same mistakes.</p>
<p>(3) is probably the most sensible choice, but if I didn't think there was some promise in the language I wouldn't be pursuing (1).</p>

          <title>Understanding Definitional Scoping</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[DefinitionalUsername]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Questions</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I just started learning Red/Rebol, and I was having trouble understanding the scoping rules. I did read the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/21964858" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Stack Overflow</a> and <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Rebol_Programming/Advanced/Bindology" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Bindology</a>, and I think I somewhat understand, but I'm not sure! I'd be grateful if someone can confirm the my deductions about the following code from the SE post:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">rebol []

a: 1

func-1: func [] [a]

inner: context [
    a: 2
    func-2: func [] [a]
    func-3: func [/local a] [a: 3 func-1]
]

reduce [func-1 inner/func-2 inner/func-3]
</code></pre>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Compile-time:</strong> First, when the code is compiled, a list of top-level names is created. <em>(<code>a</code>, <code>func-1</code>, <code>inner</code>)</em>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Load-time:</strong> When the code is loaded, context <strong>A</strong> is created with those symbols as members. Also, the entire code is walked through, and every occurrence of those symbols is bound to these entries. <em>(e.g., <code>a</code> inside <code>func-2</code> would be bound to the top-level <code>a</code>)</em>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Run-time:</strong> When <code>a: 1</code> is executed, the value <code>1</code> is stored in the <code>a</code>'s slot in the context.</li>
<li>The <code>func</code> keyword after <code>func-1:</code> creates a new function, and assigns it to <code>func-1</code>. However, it leaves the binding of <code>a</code> intact.</li>
<li>The <code>context</code> keyword after <code>inner:</code> creates a new context <strong>B</strong>, walks over all the block, collecting all new symbols, and inserts those in the new object.</li>
<li>
<code>a: 2</code> assigns value <code>2</code> in <code>a</code>'s slot in the new context.</li>
<li>
<code>func</code> after <code>func-2:</code> creates a function while keeping <code>a</code>'s new binding intact, and assigns it to <code>func-2</code>'s slot.</li>
<li>
<code>func</code> after <code>func-3:</code> creates a function and creates a new context <strong>C</strong> in which <code>a</code> is inserted and bound.</li>
<li>Upon execution of <code>reduce</code>, <code>func-1</code> returns <code>1</code> from context <strong>A</strong>, <code>func-2</code> return <code>2</code> from context <strong>B</strong>, and <code>func-3</code> executes <code>func-1</code> which returns <code>1</code> from context <strong>A</strong> again.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, now,  a few questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the above correct? If it is,</li>
<li>How does the <code>context</code> keyword determine which set-words it should create a slot for? i.e.,
<ul>
<li>if <code>a: 2</code> didn't exist, will it still create the slot for <code>a</code> due to <code>a: 3</code> deep inside?</li>
<li>What about if <code>a:3</code> didn't exist either? Will the new context contain a slot for <code>a</code> just due to <code>a</code> inside <code>func-2</code>'s body?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Did <code>context</code> bind <code>a</code> in <code>[/local a]</code> too, before <code>func</code> was executed?</li>
<li>When a new context is created, does it copy existing symbols or bindings from the older context? If not,</li>
<li>Is there a parent-child relationship between contexts, or are they free-standing? Given a context, can I chase some pointer to its parent or child?</li>
</ul>
<p>Sorry for so many questions, I think I am getting extra confused since I already have programming experience and need to unlearn some stuff before being able to grok Rebol.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hi. I'm new to Ren-C and have been trying to get this simple parser to work.</p>

          <title>Building on VS 2019</title>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Thought I'd have a look at the newest ren-c, but I tried and failed to build on VS 2019.  Wondering if builds with Visual Studio 2019 should be working or if that's on hold for now?</p>
<p>If it's on hold until a request, don't spend a lot of time trying to get it working for just me as my immediate interest and priority now is in end user business tools and integration for myself and my wife rather than language work per se. I.e web api's and <a href="http://vb.net">vb.net</a> because I need whip up things in languages I'm familiar with to get things done with little time.</p>
<p>What I did:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Copied r3-windows-x86-8994d23.exe to ./prebuilt</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Installed VS C++ tools (clicked the box that looked right).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run a command file with the following:</p>
<p>call "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvars64.bat"<br>
set R3_MAKE=C:\Projects\ren-c\prebuilt\r3-windows-x86-8994d23.exe<br>
"%R3_MAKE%" ../make.r config: ../configs/vs2019-x64.r debug: asserts optimize: 2</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What I got was:</p>
<pre><code>...
Dynamic extensions
** Script Error: generate has no value
** Where: switch for-each do catch either else _ do
** Near: [rebmake visual-studio ~~ generate (x86)]
** File: ../make.r
** Line: 871
</code></pre>
<p>Then I changed the line in make for the vs2019 target from:</p>
<pre><code>rebmake/visual-studio/generate/(x86) output-dir solution
</code></pre>
<p>to:</p>
<pre><code>rebmake/makefile/generate/(x86) output-dir solution
</code></pre>
<p>and got a different error, so then I thought I'd ask here, since I'm clueless about compiling with C, C++.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

          <title>Returning a Rebol void value</title>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>When I created the MySQL extension, the way to return a void value from a function was to do a simple</p>
<pre><code>return rebVoid();
</code></pre>
<p>Now I am dealing with the GTK3 extension and I suspect something about this has changed. Multiple occasions where I return a void like this appear to be resulting in a segfault and quitting the console as a result as well.</p>
<p>Was this method indeed changed? Or  could it be that it is just unintentionally broken?</p>
<p>Should the</p>
<pre><code>return rebVoid();
</code></pre>
<p>be replaced by</p>
<pre><code>return Init_Void(D_OUT, SYM_VOID);

          <title>Printing from inside a C function with rebElide</title>

            <p>Not sure this is the right place for this question.</p>
<p>To help myself with the workings of the GTK3 binding, I want to put in some printing statements showing the values of certain items.</p>
<p>I have this working code where I want to print the return value of the C function from within another function</p>
<pre><code>unsigned int result = gtk_main_level();
REBVAL *text = rebValue("{}");
rebElide("append", text , rebI(result));
rebElide("print {after append}");
rebElide("print", text);
rebRelease(text);
</code></pre>
<p>The thing is I was expecting the fifth line replaced by:</p>
<pre><code>rebElide("print {The value of gtk_main_level equals", text, "}");
</code></pre>
<p>also to work, but this results in the exiting of the program with a segfault.<br>
Why is this?</p>

            <p>Just looked at the source of COUNT-UP and I expected to find a reference to FOR or another function to handle the details, but I only found some MAKE action!, MAKE frame! and MAKE typeset! in there.</p>
<p>So now wondering how this works..</p>

            <p>Perhaps this needs to be in a (sub)category of its own.</p>
<p>You know the feeling that you want to do something that looks really simple but how to do this in Rebol/Ren-C</p>
<p>Case:<br>
A. Transforming the content of a block into a string</p>
<p>B. Transforming the content of a string to become a block</p>
<p>First try:<br>
A.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; blk: [What becomes of a block when turned into a {} value?]
== [What becomes of a block when turned into a "" value?]
&gt;&gt; mold blk
== {[What becomes of a block when turned into a "" value?]}
</code></pre>
<p>B.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; txt: "What becomes of a string when turned into a [] value?"
== {What becomes of a string when turned into a [] value?}
&gt;&gt; to block! txt
== [{What becomes of a string when turned into a [] value?}]
</code></pre>
<p>So clearly not what was intended!</p>
<p>After some tinkering:<br>
A.</p>
<pre><code>block-to-text: function [blk [block!]][
    result: copy ""
    spacer: copy ""
    for-each b blk [
        append append result spacer mold b
        spacer: copy " "
    ]
    result
]
block-to-text blk
== {What becomes of a block when turned into a "" value?}
</code></pre>
<p>B.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; blk: load append append "[" txt "]"       
== [What becomes of a string when turned into a [] value?]
</code></pre>
<p>To be improved?</p>

          <category>Questions</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>First of all, although somewhere in the back of my mind I heard about Ren-C, my programming time has been limited over the years and so I still mainly use R2 with some Red thrown in. I was working on some library stuff which led me to Nick's site which lead me to the Rebol 2019 videos. Holy Cow! Is this what you all have been up to?<br>
Anyway, I've been trying to compile the Ren-C R3 version (I'll put together a beginner's tutorial at some point) and I get these warnings several times during the compilation:<br>
In function 'rebJumps_inline':       prep\include/rebol.h:1040: warning: 'noreturn' function does return<br>
In function 'rebJumpsQ_inline':prep\include/rebol.h:1048: warning: 'noreturn' function does return</p>
<p>When the script appears to end I don't see any .exe file</p>
<p>Any ideas on how to proceed?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
TimeSlip, AKA James_Nak</p>

          <title>REBOL on embedded systems, STM32</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[jhgorse]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Questions</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I am impressed with REBOL's lack of dependencies and reasonable use of resources. I am curious just how thin we can get the runtime library both with and without TinyC for use on the STM32 ARM Cortex-M MCU. A typical Cortex-M MCU may have between 64 to 2048 kB of internal flash memory and 32 to 1024 kB of RAM.</p>
<p>The Hello World of the embedded world is blinking LED and is called, affectionately, Blinky. It involves an element of timing and the writing of data to an output register (e.g. GPIOx-&gt;ODR for STM32).</p>
<p>I would like to try REBOL for this use case.</p>
<p>What would it take to give this a go on an embedded Cortex-M MCU?</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
Joe Gorse</p>

          <title>Make a Rebol: minimum viable rebol interpreters</title>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>What would it take for me to kick off this process and build a minimum viable rebol interpreter as a learning exercise?</p>
<p>I've recently been interested in the a <a href="https://github.com/kanaka/mal" rel="nofollow noopener">"make a lisp"</a> project as a powerful learning tool for both learning lisp and for learning other languages. Does anyone have any thoughts as to the feasibility of this for rebol?</p>
<p>I understand that having a good vetted implementation for doing "real work" like Ren-C or Red is important (keep the WASM build coming), but I'm coming to believe that some of the staying power of lisp is that in terms of choosing dependencies for long term projects something that you can build from scratch with dozens of examples is pretty good future proofing.</p>

            <p><em>(2022 note: This question from 2019 and response were lifted out of a thread that was otherwise outdated enough to warrant deleting...trying to update the answer.)</em></p>
<hr>
<p><a class="mention" href="https://forum.rebol.info/u/hostilefork">@hostilefork</a> says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think any illusions of Ren-C being able to bring evaluator "safety" to a fundamentally unsafe language are being stripped away with time.  Instead, what's actually happening is that the features are getting laser-calibrated to where an informed programmer can write short, correct, code easily... the right thing is the short thing, not something riddled with edge-case handling.</p>
<p>Clarity is a <em>catalyst</em> for safety in a language.  But beyond that, the bias seems tipping ever toward being clean and powerful enough to <a href="https://forum.rebol.info/t/make-your-own-safety/1118">"make your own you-made-a-mistake-catching-safety mechanisms"</a>...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Clarity and brevity are two fundamental qualities of good writing. I think that applies to programming as well. Also 4 concepts so close (NULL, BLANK!, NONE! and VOID), make me look for a fundamental problem in the language, or they do not have adequate names.</p>
<p>I do not quite understand the usefulness of these 4 variants but should not there be one, or several but named to make understand to which functionalities of the language they relate (block, value, refinement ...)? Maybe I get it wrong.</p>

<p>I can not refrain from making the connection with Erlang while thinking that the concept is quite different even if the intention is the same in the words. To see later.</p>

<p>REBOL introduces the concept of dialecting</p>

<p>Dialecting is very interesting. I find this a paper, <a href="http://www.gkc.org.uk/martin/papers/middle-out-t.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">Language Oriented Programming</a> of M. P. Ward about it. Have to read it.</p>

<p>This is the aspect that I think keeps the whole very compact. I hope it's extensible, though.</p>

            <p>Since <a class="mention" href="https://forum.rebol.info/u/lkppo">@LkpPo</a> reported problems creating new threads, and <a class="mention" href="https://forum.rebol.info/u/gchiu">@gchiu</a> seems to be MIA the last 4 days on holiday, I thought I'd create a new thread to offer any building support.  This is generally done on StackOverflow, but we can do it here as well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I will try a build on OpenBSD, provided I’m migrating on this system instead of Debian.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>We haven't done a bootstrap to a system we don't have binaries for in a while (!)</p>
<p>The idea is that there are some generated files, and to generate these files you need a working Rebol.  But what you can do is you can be on one machine and tell it to build a "prep" directory with all these files for another target machine.  Then you move that folder over and build with a C compiler, and get your executable.  Now you're bootstrapped: you can use that executable for any subsequent builds.</p>
<p>This hasn't happened since we went to an "all Rebol" build system.  The build system is big...Shixin wrote it and I think probably considered working on it as annoying as I would.  So it didn't really get documentation or peer review.  But on the upside, <em>it is all Rebol</em> - so you don't need GNU make or other tools installed.  And when we wrangle it to try and make it better we can use Rebol to do so...so it doesn't feel like as much a waste of time as fiddling with CMake/etc.  It provides experience that feeds back into improvement of the language, and a much-needed "big" test case.</p>
<h2>Debian is probably the best system to try <em>first</em>
</h2>
<p>You should be able to go to the %make/ directory and type:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>./r3-linux-x64-8994d23 make.r</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That will run a Ren-C executable <a href="https://github.com/metaeducation/ren-c/commit/8994d23" rel="nofollow noopener">built at commit 8994d23</a>.  There are various options you can use, here's an example of settings I use for development on Linux:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>./r3-linux-x64-8994d23 make.r config: configs/generic-c++.r optimize: 0 rigorous: true debug: sanitize standard: c++17 target: makefile static: yes</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That generates a heavily instrumented build with Address Sanitizer, that runs slow but catches a lot of issues.  It uses C++ to build, which adds extra checks at compile-time, though is equivalent at runtime to the C build.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what your specific areas of interest or skills are, but reply to this thread if you need any help... or ideally, join StackOverflow and ask a couple of Q&amp;A there.  We can help upvote you to get chat privileges (it's very easy, only 20 points).</p>

          <title>Some questions about FFI (libuv)</title>

          <category>Questions</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I have two questions. I'm trying to make a test binding to libuv ... I don't quite understand few things on the rebol and on c side.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>When c creates a struct and passes its address to a function that then sets its fields.</p>
<p>static struct sockaddr_in addr4;<br>
uv_ip4_addr(address_ip4, port, &amp;addr4);</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>What should I do on FFI side to achieve the same? I tried to just allocate some memory (via malloc) and pass a pointer to that instead but it doesn't seem to work. I also tried to create hopefully correct struct! and pass addr-of to func but it doesn't seem to get set. In first case I can't know for sure, since I can't see what the address holds after the call, but the later c function that uses the addr behaves as if it weren't correctly set.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>... I have a function that you give pointer to char and it sets the string to it. Is there a way to get to the containing c-string on that address from rebol side after it sets it?</p>
<p>int uv_ip4_name(const struct sockaddr_in* src, char* dst, size_t size)</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Is there any "getting started" page for this sort of thing? I feel really dumb by not knowing this stuff. So far I have downloaded ren-c source and compiled it. Made a simple c file, included the header ... but I guess I need the library now. Which I don't know if is already built by make (and I can't find it), or do I have to call make specifically to build it, or this should all be done in different way altogether.</p>

            <p>Everybody is new to Rebol at some point. Whether you are struggling with the installation or you just can't figure out why you are not seeing the performance everybody else seems to be talking about.</p>
<p>To make helping you easy, explain what you are planning to do and how you are currently doing. Post some code (a minimal reproducible example).</p>
<p>A lot of questions have already been answered so make sure you searched this forum and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rebol+or+rebol2+or+rebol3+or+red">StackOverflow's using Redbol tags</a> first.</p>
