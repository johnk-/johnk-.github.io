          <title>How Could Money Be Applied To Further Ren-C?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[hostilefork]]></dc:creator>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I've been starting to think about questions of how to further the development of Ren-C by spending some money on it.</p>
<h2><a name="p-8475-longest-running-idea-puzzle-solving-bounties-1" class="anchor" href="https://rebol.metaeducation.com#p-8475-longest-running-idea-puzzle-solving-bounties-1"></a>Longest-Running Idea: Puzzle-Solving Bounties</h2>
<p>I keep talking about having small ($100-ish) bounties for people coming up with efficient solutions to code golfing puzzles, to drum up interest.</p>
<p>That's taking some time to launch... because I want the language to be relatively complete in its design.  I want it to be that when people write up blog entries or a community starts building around the puzzles, they're generating artifacts of actual lasting value...because it speaks in terms of the language in its relatively final design.</p>
<p>Things just haven't been stable enough to go there yet.  I hope it can soon, but it won't be tomorrow.</p>
<h2><a name="p-8475-other-ideas-to-use-money-before-then-2" class="anchor" href="https://rebol.metaeducation.com#p-8475-other-ideas-to-use-money-before-then-2"></a>Other Ideas To Use Money Before Then?</h2>
<p>AI is teaching me that it's hard--even with a relatively competent assistant who never sleeps--to meaningfully delegate work.  So I'm skeptical of trying to hire someone to work on the interpreter... because anyone who is actually good enough to help vs. hinder would likely be expensive.</p>
<p>Though... I dunno.  The job market kind of sucks.  Maybe there are young go-getters who would be eager to take a small amount of pay to work on open source with a Microsoft Research veteran.  <img src="https://rebol.metaeducation.com/images/emoji/twitter/man_shrugging.png?v=14" title=":man_shrugging:" class="emoji" alt=":man_shrugging:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
<p>For it to do anything for someone's resume, would probably have to incorporate and make a serious looking website.  <a class="mention" href="https://rebol.metaeducation.com/u/blackattr">@BlackATTR</a> is a reputable businessperson, maybe he could help it look respectable.</p>
<h2><a name="p-8475-working-with-indie-game-devs-3" class="anchor" href="https://rebol.metaeducation.com#p-8475-working-with-indie-game-devs-3"></a>Working With Indie Game Devs?</h2>
<p>If I could find a game dev who was willing to hack up a prototype of the game I want to do, in order to try and secure further development, that would be great.  But I don't know any such people I know trust to say "hey I'll pay your bills for a month or two while you work up this demo":</p>
<p><a href="https://rebol.metaeducation.com/t/rebmu-the-graphical-game/2499" class="inline-onebox">Rebmu: The Graphical Game</a></p>
<h2><a name="p-8475-bounties-for-publicity-projects-to-receptive-markets-4" class="anchor" href="https://rebol.metaeducation.com#p-8475-bounties-for-publicity-projects-to-receptive-markets-4"></a>Bounties For Publicity Projects To Receptive Markets?</h2>
<p><a href="https://discuss.haiku-os.org/t/rebol-3-19-0-released-and-how-to-get-it-on-haikudepot/16643">Oldes made the announcement of his Rebol3 on Haiku to what were predictably crickets.</a></p>
<p>But matters might be different with a more impressive language, if one could demo a skeletal tool that could do something novel on Haiku, and would fund development of it to become useful in some official community capacity?</p>
<p>For perspective, <a href="https://www.haiku-os.org/">their whole project fundraising target is just $30,000</a>... that's for the whole thing, and they're at $11,000.  If $10k is the kind of money that can move a needle with them...might it be worth the money to fund something that could build interest in the tool?</p>
<h2><a name="p-8475-ideas-welcome-5" class="anchor" href="https://rebol.metaeducation.com#p-8475-ideas-welcome-5"></a>Ideas Welcome.</h2>
<p>My confidence in the design is starting to get very high, and while I'm historically reticent to promote anything... it's actually coming up on time to do something akin to marketing.  And if I could be reasonably sure I'd actually get meaningful return for spending money on the project, I would spend it.</p>

            <p>Hi guys<br>
I think it is time to turn off the old rebolbot server as I have not been using it for a while. <a class="mention" href="https://rebol.metaeducation.com/u/rgchris">@rgchris</a> may still have a few things running on it, so this is a heads up that I plan to turn it off in the next month or so.<br>
All the best,<br>
John</p>

            <p>Hey Guys,</p>
<p>I am coming out of hiding <img src="https://rebol.metaeducation.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=14" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20">  I had some family obligations come up last year, but these are all at manageable levels now. I appreciate <a class="mention" href="https://rebol.metaeducation.com/u/blackattr">@BlackATTR</a> and <a class="mention" href="https://rebol.metaeducation.com/u/hostilefork">@hostilefork</a> for keeping in touch, and I see you guys have a launch coming up this year.

<p>How can I help? I remember we had a lot of outstanding decisions to be made for the website, the last time we talked. What is the top priority at the moment?</p>
<p>I got a chance to try out Rebol in the browser, and that is just awesome, nice work!</p>

          <title>Rebol.org Archived Scripts</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[BrianOtto]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Community</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I have a proof-of-concept up now, for integrating the archived scripts into the new site.</p>
<aside class="onebox allowlistedgeneric" data-onebox-src="http://reboldocs.brianotto.com/docs/archived/scripts/form-date.r.html">
  <header class="source">

      <a href="http://reboldocs.brianotto.com/docs/archived/scripts/form-date.r.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">reboldocs.brianotto.com</a>
  </header>

  <article class="onebox-body">
    

<h3><a href="http://reboldocs.brianotto.com/docs/archived/scripts/form-date.r.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Rebol</a></h3>



  </article>

  <div class="onebox-metadata">
    
    
  </div>

  <div style="clear: both"></div>
</aside>

<p>Try switching the version (in the top-left corner where it says "Archived") and you can see how the Documentation section is able to seamlessly switch between the two different looks, and also have two different types of content.</p>
<p>So this is working pretty nicely, but I have run into a lot of questions (and potential issues) too ...</p>
<h3><a name="p-1955-do-you-like-the-retro-look-1" class="anchor" href="https://rebol.metaeducation.com#p-1955-do-you-like-the-retro-look-1"></a>Do you like the retro look?</h3>
<p>I am having a hard-time deciding if it is really, really bad or really, really good <img src="https://rebol.metaeducation.com/images/emoji/twitter/rofl.png?v=14" title=":rofl:" class="emoji" alt=":rofl:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
<p>It's sort of a mashup of <a class="mention" href="https://rebol.metaeducation.com/u/rgchris">@rgchris</a> <a href="http://scripts.rebol.info" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">site</a> and Rebol Desktop. However, I think I took it too literally and got stuck in the 90's. Then again, maybe the retro feel is tugging at your heart strings. Turn on some Cobain and then let me know what you think!</p>
<h3><a name="p-1955-should-the-script-use-different-prettify-highlighting-2" class="anchor" href="https://rebol.metaeducation.com#p-1955-should-the-script-use-different-prettify-highlighting-2"></a>Should the script use different Prettify highlighting?</h3>
<p>I think it's clashing a bit with the rest of the archived page. Using the colors <a class="mention" href="https://rebol.metaeducation.com/u/rgchris">@rgchris</a> used on his site would look better (assuming we want to keep the page's color scheme, or some variation of it). But then again, I wasn't sure if we wanted to keep all code examples looking the same on the site (regardless of if it was archived or not). Any opinions on this?</p>
<h3><a name="p-1955-do-we-have-the-rights-to-use-the-old-rebol-logo-andor-rebol-desktop-icons-3" class="anchor" href="https://rebol.metaeducation.com#p-1955-do-we-have-the-rights-to-use-the-old-rebol-logo-andor-rebol-desktop-icons-3"></a>Do we have the rights to use the old Rebol logo and/or Rebol Desktop icons?</h3>
<p>I'm guessing we don't, but I thought I would ask. If we don't, then what other logo would we use?</p>
<h3><a name="p-1955-do-we-need-to-keep-all-old-links-4" class="anchor" href="https://rebol.metaeducation.com#p-1955-do-we-need-to-keep-all-old-links-4"></a>Do we need to keep all old links?</h3>
<p>I got the following links redirecting properly ...</p>
<ul>
<li>View Script - <a href="http://reboldocs.brianotto.com/view-script.r?script=form-date.r" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">http://reboldocs.brianotto.com/view-script.r?script=form-date.r</a></li>
<li>View Documentation - <a href="http://reboldocs.brianotto.com/documentation.r?script=form-date.r" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">http://reboldocs.brianotto.com/documentation.r?script=form-date.r</a></li>
<li>Download Script - <a href="http://reboldocs.brianotto.com/download-a-script.r?script-name=form-date.r" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">http://reboldocs.brianotto.com/download-a-script.r?script-name=form-date.r</a></li>
</ul>
<p>However, I noticed there are a lot more links in the old Script Library. For example ...</p>
<ul>
<li>History - <a href="http://www.rebol.org/script-history.r?script-name=form-date.r" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Script Library: form-date.r</a></li>
<li>License - <a href="http://www.rebol.org/license-help.r?script-name=form-date.r" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Script Library: form-date.r</a></li>
<li>Download Doc as HTML - <a href="http://www.rebol.org/doc-download.r?script-name=form-date.r&amp;format=html" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">REBOL.org Script Library</a></li>
<li>Download Doc as Editable Plain - <a href="http://www.rebol.org/doc-download.r?script-name=form-date.r&amp;format=plain" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">http://www.rebol.org/doc-download.r?script-name=form-date.r&amp;format=plain</a></li>
<li>Other Scripts by Author - <a href="http://www.rebol.org/cpt-list-scripts.r?user-name=chrisrg" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">http://www.rebol.org/cpt-list-scripts.r?user-name=chrisrg</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Do they all need to keep working? I think some of these are going to be challenging, if not impossible, to get working on a static Github site.</p>
<p>What about the links on the rest of the <a href="http://www.rebol.org" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">http://www.rebol.org</a> site (i.e. AltME, Mail List, Articles, Search, etc)? If we take over the domain one day, are all these links expected to keep working? This would be possible if we had control over the web server, but it is not possible on Github... which leads me to my next question.</p>
<h3><a name="p-1955-are-you-okay-with-javascript-redirects-5" class="anchor" href="https://rebol.metaeducation.com#p-1955-are-you-okay-with-javascript-redirects-5"></a>Are you okay with JavaScript redirects?</h3>
<p>A static Github site can not use HTTP redirects, i.e. it cannot send back a 301, 302 or 303 header to the client. I had to get those redirects working by using a "meta refresh" tag, which means all redirects are sending back a 200 OK. It works, but it's not really the way they should be done. Also, on top of that, these old links have parameters that identify the script to load up (e.g. ?script=form-date.r), and the only way to parse that on a static site is by using JavaScript.</p>
<p>The page loads, I use JavaScript to grab the name of the script, and then using JavaScript again, I write the "meta refresh" tag to the HTML, and this tells the browser to send me to the correct /docs/archived/scripts/ page. So this solution will work, but only with a browser, because it has the ability to run JavaScript. If a HTTP cURL client or Rebol script was loading the page, it would not get redirected properly.</p>

            <p>I have added the <a href="http://reboldocs.brianotto.com/roadmap" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Roadmap</a> mockup now, and I was wondering if you like the design and layout of the page? You will need to view it on a desktop / laptop screen. It doesn't display nicely on mobile right now, but that can always be fixed. I just wanted to get some first impressions before I spent more time on it.</p>
<p>Also, I understand you may not want to list dates here, and so they could be removed. And instead of displaying the year in the circle, it could be something like a checkbox icon, and it gets checked when a milestone has been reached.</p>
<p>Let me know your thoughts, thanks!</p>

          <title>Rebol.org Front Page Code Samples</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[hostilefork]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Community</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>The very promising <a href="http://reboldocs.brianotto.com/">prototype for rebol.org</a> has a current design where a blurb of text sits to the left of a panel of code on the right.  One can click buttons to get the code on the right to slide to some alternative examples.  The space currently used by the code is about 12 lines long, and about 45 characters wide.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="https://rebol.metaeducation.com/u/brianotto">@BrianOtto</a> picked a few random tidbits from things he had <em>(which included a use of COLLECT in PARSE, which is not at the moment in Ren-C, which is something we need to discuss/confront at some point)</em>.  But I've suggested that these samples should be punchy and well designed to demonstrate specific points about the language...and each time you switch to a new code sample, the text on the left would change to be some overview of what the sample is meant to demonstrate.</p>
<p>When the page first comes up, the left text should probably be broad and general...probably mostly capturing a "vision statement" of the overall project.  I'm not sure what code example would go best with that.  Maybe not a code example at all, but an animation of how easy to compile or install the project is.  Who knows?  Anyway, what's on the left and right when people first land on the page would have to be decided.</p>
<p>But assuming the page keeps its current form (vs moving to something like <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/~jps/animated_gifs_the_hard_way.html">Sublime Text's PNG animation</a>), one might wonder what the text and samples should be as you page through them.  What are the points?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Code is Data</strong> - show BLOCK! restructuring/composition and execution via DO.</li>
<li><strong>No Keywords</strong> - can a brief example that isn't PARSE show how taking advantage of re-using IF or something is a powerful idea?  Is there an easy "killer" case that can show why this is good and not dangerous/bad?</li>
<li><strong>Natural Datatypes</strong> - some sort of quick gloss of <a href="http://www.rebol.com/rebolsteps.html">Rebol in ten steps</a></li>
<li><strong>Freedom of Choice</strong> - perhaps show some quick contrasts of ways to write a statement... IF/ELSE vs. THEN vs. ALL OR vs EITHER.</li>
<li><strong>Evaluator Unchained</strong> - I'd personally like a punchy example of something like how + can be made to switch modes from infix to prefix, and how easy this is in userspace...so showing off infix/variadics somehow.</li>
<li><strong>"Markdown of Programming"</strong> - Something about how the language has been agonized over to be pretty and not need IDEs or syntax highlighting, maybe even emphasize something like <code>--: function [...] [...]</code> to get a separator construct for <code>-- "Yes you can do this" --</code>.  Mention the fact that the code examples being black and white isn't an accident.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is just to start the conversation, if people want to pick their favorite 40x12 matrix of code to show off.  So if you have an idea: what's the code, what's the bullet point and blurb to go with it?</p>
<p>One place to look for inspiration would be <a href="https://trello.com/b/l385BE7a/rebol3-porting-guide-ren-c-branch">the Trello</a>.  What on there is "wow" for you?  Could that be condensed into a little box of "wow"?</p>
<p><em>Something to consider:</em> how to show output?  This isn't an interactive console session, so should it be just put in with comments?  This will take up space in the examples, so should be considered so people know what the code they're looking at <em>does</em>.</p>

            <p>If you view the <a href="http://reboldocs.brianotto.com/docs/3.0/insert" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Documentation</a> page on a mobile phone, you will see that the left-hand navigation appears at the top and you have to scroll through it to get to the content. Right now, it's not so bad, but as we add more sections I think that is going to get too long and be a pain to have to scroll through.</p>
<p>So we have two possible solutions... we could either display all sections collapsed when the site is viewed on mobile, or we could move the entire nav into the hamburger menu. For the latter, there could be a divider after the Download button and the documentation nav would display underneath it (and maybe there could be some kind of header or styling to make it clear that this is a sub-nav for the Documentation page).</p>
<p>Do you guys have a preference?</p>

            <p>I've mentioned that my concept of being "showy" for Rebol is to try and really make it about the code, and to stick to a near-typewriter aesthetic.  Here's a suggested starting theme modification for code samples:</p>
<pre><code>pre .str, code .str { color: #000000; } /* string  - black */
pre .kwd, code .kwd { color: #000000; } /* keyword - black */
pre .typ, code .typ { color: #000000; } /* type - black */
pre .lit, code .lit { color: #000000; } /* literal - black */
pre .pun, code .pun { color: #000000; } /* punctuation - black */
pre .pln, code .pln { color: #000000; } /* plaintext - black */
pre .tag, code .tag { color: #000000; } /* html/xml tag - black */
pre .atn, code .atn { color: #000000; } /* html/xml attribute name - black */
pre .atv, code .atv { color: #000000; } /* html/xml attribute value - black */
pre .dec, code .dec {
    font-weight: bold; color: #000000; /* dec (declaration?) - black and bold */
}
pre .com, code .com {
    color: #707080; font-style: italic; /* comment - gray ok if still dark */
}

pre.prettyprint, code.prettyprint {
	background-color: #FFFEFE; /* white or real close to white */
	-moz-border-radius: 8px;
	-webkit-border-radius: 8px;
	-o-border-radius: 8px;
	-ms-border-radius: 8px;
	-khtml-border-radius: 8px;
	border-radius: 8px;
}
</code></pre>
<p>I've mentioned some of the reasons why I believe this is the way to go--beyond my personal dislike of making one's code look like it has circus colors:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In a language with no keywords, colorizing "keywords" does not make sense.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sticking to black and white helps show off the work done to try and reduce visual noise.  That message gets lost when you add...visual noise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The stated goal of the language is to be readable and editable without an IDE--and be pleasant to look at and work with in that state.  I think other principles (like sticking to 80 columns, however "archaic" that may sound) is a good guideline as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Matches the logo and the theme, lets color be used more strategically elsewhere on the site vs becoming something you have to "tune out".</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The one most critical thing to highlight, IMO, is the bolding of the SET-WORD!s and SET-PATH!s to further call them out...separating definitions and references.  I think that comments being a slightly-less-dark-shade, and maybe even italic, could be all right.</p>
<p>If this is generally accepted as the idea for the base theme (perhaps permitting a browser cookie or something to change themes if later ones are invented) then I think that helps when answering broad structure questions about contrast on the rest of the site, how to get balance of black and white regions, etc.</p>

            <p>The prototype <a href="http://reboldocs.brianotto.com/">rebol.org</a> page features boxes for recent news.</p>
<p>Rather than launch with a completely empty news feed, I'm wondering if we want to take old commit announcements of features and put them in the chronology.</p>
<p>We've already done a "filling in" of the <a href="https://github.com/rebol/rebol-issues/issues?page=68&amp;q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen">bugs in rebol-issues</a>, keeping them accurate with the CureCode dates.  It helps people get an understanding that there has been a history, as opposed to Rebol just popping out of nowhere.  We could combine the announcements from a GitHub commit with some stuff from a Trello to get an announcement.  For instance the <a href="https://github.com/metaeducation/ren-c/commit/fc7c536c66a87369b1384ebd02d80c3cb0468817">HIJACK commit</a> from Jun 19, 2016 would suggest a news announcement at that time would be fitting.</p>
<p>Perhaps even adding some even older curated news items out of the old AltME announcements of notable historical things, to put the dates in context:</p>
<p><a href="http://rebol.info/altme/105/announce" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://rebol.info/altme/105/announce</a></p>
<p>...or important announcements from Carl's blog (if there's any issue with quoting the content in its entirety, a summary with a fair-use quote would do).  Things like the open sourcing announcement...just to fill out a timeline.</p>
<p>It might be easiest if those news items were just posts here on the forum in a category...which were transcluded to look like a news feed.  That would facilitate discussion as well as make edits easier, and fold in with a database that has to be running and backed up anyway.</p>

          <title>Rebol Docs Experiment</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[BrianOtto]]></dc:creator>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I did an interesting experiment with the <a href="https://github.com/gchiu/reboldocs" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Rebol Docs</a> repository today.</p>
<p>I forked it and in my copy I setup up the master branch to be the source for Github pages. This ended up giving me a <a href="http://brianotto.github.io/reboldocs" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Rebol</a> URL which I then mapped to a sub domain at <a href="http://reboldocs.brianotto.com" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">http://reboldocs.brianotto.com</a>.</p>
<p>I committed the website source I have been working on and then linked the Documentation section to one of the help Markdown files, i.e. <a href="http://reboldocs.brianotto.com/insert" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">http://reboldocs.brianotto.com/insert</a> (which is really <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BrianOtto/reboldocs/master/insert.MD" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">insert.MD</a>), and Github now renders any Markdown I add there to HTML, automatically creating a documentation page for me. I had been working on some small code examples, before starting on the website, and so this what you see listed there.</p>
<p>So it appears like we could use the already existing MD files for two purposes, the interpreter help and the website documentation. One thing I did have to do was add HTML comments (i.e. &lt;!--) around the interpreter help section so the website wouldn't render them. Would it be easy to ignore these by the interpreter?</p>
<p>Anyway, this basically gives us the ability to have URLs named after any of the documents in that repository. Also, the content is controlled by Github, and so the repository can be forked and anyone can contribute using only a markdown editor and sending a PR. There is no need to install Jekyll or the likes.</p>
<p>However, there is still one issue I am looking into and that is the ability to maintain the website header and footer on each of the documentation pages and to have some kind of navigation display. I <em>think</em> you can create a template that all MD files get rendered in, but still looking into this ...</p>
<p>What do you think? Do you like this approach?</p>

            <p>I've got a rough estimate for updating TLS from Cyphre depending on what we need of $1500-2000.</p>
<p>I'll ask him to post to this thread what he wants to know.</p>
<p>Basically I think we need TLS 1.2 with ECDHE. Full server implementation also nice to have.</p>
<p>Eg. TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 (0xc030)</p>
<p>Please comment.</p>

            <p>We should be in a position to <a href="https://www.patreon.com/rebolfoundation">accept donations</a> both for running of this forum, rebol.info and for specific tasks.</p>
<p>I was wondering how that might happen transparently.  <a class="mention" href="https://rebol.metaeducation.com/u/blackattr">@BlackATTR</a> suggested using <a href="https://www.patreon.com/">Patreon</a> so I wonder if that could be used to fund a Rebol Foundation which then dishes out funds for the ongoing maintenance of our intrastructure.  But I see that they take 5%.</p>
<p>What about a Bitcoin address that is held by the foundation, and just takes donations? Are the transactions at one address transparent?</p>
