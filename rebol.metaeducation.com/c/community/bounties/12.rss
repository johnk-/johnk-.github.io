          <title>How Could Money Be Applied To Further Ren-C?</title>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I've been starting to think about questions of how to further the development of Ren-C by spending some money on it.</p>
<h2><a name="p-8475-longest-running-idea-puzzle-solving-bounties-1" class="anchor" href="https://rebol.metaeducation.com#p-8475-longest-running-idea-puzzle-solving-bounties-1"></a>Longest-Running Idea: Puzzle-Solving Bounties</h2>
<p>I keep talking about having small ($100-ish) bounties for people coming up with efficient solutions to code golfing puzzles, to drum up interest.</p>
<p>That's taking some time to launch... because I want the language to be relatively complete in its design.  I want it to be that when people write up blog entries or a community starts building around the puzzles, they're generating artifacts of actual lasting value...because it speaks in terms of the language in its relatively final design.</p>
<p>Things just haven't been stable enough to go there yet.  I hope it can soon, but it won't be tomorrow.</p>
<h2><a name="p-8475-other-ideas-to-use-money-before-then-2" class="anchor" href="https://rebol.metaeducation.com#p-8475-other-ideas-to-use-money-before-then-2"></a>Other Ideas To Use Money Before Then?</h2>
<p>AI is teaching me that it's hard--even with a relatively competent assistant who never sleeps--to meaningfully delegate work.  So I'm skeptical of trying to hire someone to work on the interpreter... because anyone who is actually good enough to help vs. hinder would likely be expensive.</p>
<p>Though... I dunno.  The job market kind of sucks.  Maybe there are young go-getters who would be eager to take a small amount of pay to work on open source with a Microsoft Research veteran.  <img src="https://rebol.metaeducation.com/images/emoji/twitter/man_shrugging.png?v=14" title=":man_shrugging:" class="emoji" alt=":man_shrugging:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
<p>For it to do anything for someone's resume, would probably have to incorporate and make a serious looking website.  <a class="mention" href="https://rebol.metaeducation.com/u/blackattr">@BlackATTR</a> is a reputable businessperson, maybe he could help it look respectable.</p>

<p>If I could find a game dev who was willing to hack up a prototype of the game I want to do, in order to try and secure further development, that would be great.  But I don't know any such people I know trust to say "hey I'll pay your bills for a month or two while you work up this demo":</p>

<p><a href="https://discuss.haiku-os.org/t/rebol-3-19-0-released-and-how-to-get-it-on-haikudepot/16643">Oldes made the announcement of his Rebol3 on Haiku to what were predictably crickets.</a></p>
<p>But matters might be different with a more impressive language, if one could demo a skeletal tool that could do something novel on Haiku, and would fund development of it to become useful in some official community capacity?</p>
<p>For perspective, <a href="https://www.haiku-os.org/">their whole project fundraising target is just $30,000</a>... that's for the whole thing, and they're at $11,000.  If $10k is the kind of money that can move a needle with them...might it be worth the money to fund something that could build interest in the tool?</p>
<h2><a name="p-8475-ideas-welcome-5" class="anchor" href="https://rebol.metaeducation.com#p-8475-ideas-welcome-5"></a>Ideas Welcome.</h2>
<p>My confidence in the design is starting to get very high, and while I'm historically reticent to promote anything... it's actually coming up on time to do something akin to marketing.  And if I could be reasonably sure I'd actually get meaningful return for spending money on the project, I would spend it.</p>

          <title>Updating TLS; bounty</title>

            <p>I've got a rough estimate for updating TLS from Cyphre depending on what we need of $1500-2000.</p>
<p>I'll ask him to post to this thread what he wants to know.</p>
<p>Basically I think we need TLS 1.2 with ECDHE. Full server implementation also nice to have.</p>
<p>Eg. TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 (0xc030)</p>
<p>Please comment.</p>
