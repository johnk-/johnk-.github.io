    <title>Embracing A &quot;Useless&quot; Definition of TO</title>
    <link>https://rebol.metaeducation.com/t/embracing-a-useless-definition-of-to/2325</link>
    <description>Many years ago, I thought about **[trying to untangle of the TO and MAKE matrix](https://rebol.metaeducation.com/t/hacking-away-on-the-to-and-make-matrix/649)**.  These operations are notoriously unpredictable in historical Redbol.

I tried putting some stakes in the ground about what I believed *had* to be true.  It was difficult because I could not think of too many.

One thing I said was that TO should always create a &quot;new&quot; value (if the value was not immediate).  And I felt like this should be true:

    to (type of value) value
    ; ...same as...
    copy value

Grasping for any stake in the ground I could find, I was pretty sure that TO of a string representation of an integer to an integer should give you the integer:

    &gt;&gt; to integer! &quot;1020&quot;
    == 1020  ; we know this, at least? (one hopes...)

And the reverse, one would think, as well:

    &gt;&gt; to text! 1020
    == &quot;1020&quot;  ; what else *could* it be?  codepoint 1020? -&gt; &quot;ϼ&quot;

But beyond that it was hard to think of the pattern.

## Coming Back To An Old Idea: Reversibility

When I first encountered Rebol and was made aware of these problems, I suggested TO should be reversible:

    value1 = to (type of value1) to type2 value1

However, this gave what *appeared* to be very &quot;unexciting&quot; options for behavior:

    &gt;&gt; to block! 1
    == [1]

    &gt;&gt; to integer! [1]
    == 1

    &gt;&gt; to integer! [...anything else in a block that&#39;s not integer...]
    ** Error.  Always.

That particular idea was was so long ago that I don&#39;t have direct quotes on hand of people saying &quot;nah, that sucks, TO could barely do anything.&quot;  But I&#39;m pretty sure it was panned by basically everyone I suggested it to.  I guess I agreed, because I dropped it.

**Coming back to it now, and seeing it in a new light, I see this as much more useful than I used to.**  Especially when compared to the historical mess that makes TO nigh-unusable.

And in fact, it fits in with several Rebol2/Red behaviors that I&#39;d thought were kind of pointless before:

    &gt;&gt; to integer! &lt;1&gt;
    == 1

    &gt;&gt; to tag! 1
    == &lt;1&gt;

The use I didn&#39;t see at the time was the frequent need when dialecting to push values out of band, into some other type, without losing their meaning.  If you have a dialect in which integers already mean something, but you want a way of pushing some integer-oriented instruction in there...you can use these kinds of operations.

Definitional errors in Ren-C make this convenient, since checking if something fits the pattern is quick, you just throw in a TRY and the antiform error that&#39;s the return result of the TO will be suppressed, giving you a &quot;falsey&quot; null:

    &gt;&gt; thing: &lt;a b&gt;

    &gt;&gt; to integer! thing
    ** Error: Cannot TO convert &lt;a b&gt; to integer

    &gt;&gt; try to integer! thing
    == ~null~  ; anti

The more I look at it the more useful it appears.  And it helps give clarity to the MAKE vs. TO division.  If you have something that isn&#39;t shaped like this, then *maybe* MAKE is the right place to put it.  For example:

    &gt;&gt; to percent! 1
    == 1%

    &gt;&gt; to integer! 1%
    == 1

    &gt;&gt; make percent! 1
    == 100%

*(Note: I think ENCODE + DECODE is a better place for binary conversions, e.g. ENCODE &#39;IEEE-754 is better than MAKE BINARY! of a decimal because that could mean many things, and ENCODE can have more parameterization for single vs. double precision, etc.  I don&#39;t know
if TO BINARY! should work at all, but if it does, I&#39;d probably agree with the Rebol2 choice to give the binary representation of the UTF-8 string... e.g. (to binary! 1020) as #{31303230} ... and use more explicit future-proof routines to encode with specified byte size and endianness.)*

## Reversibility Rules Out Rounding

In order to get losslessness in the representation, you can&#39;t throw out information.

So this works:

    &gt;&gt; to integer! 1.0
    == 1

    &gt;&gt; to decimal! 1
    == 1.0

But this does not:

     &gt;&gt; to integer! 1.5
     ** Error: Can&#39;t TO INTEGER! a DECIMAL! w/digits after decimal point

I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a problem, because that seems like a job for ROUND.  Unfortunately, R3-Alpha and Red do something dumb:

    rebol2&gt;&gt; round 1.5
    == 2

    red&gt;&gt; round 1.5
    == 2.0

    r3-alpha&gt;&gt; round 1.5
    == 2.0

It seems this was part of a shift to try and preserve the input type, to facilitate things like rounding MONEY!:

    r3-alpha&gt;&gt; round $1.50
    == $2

So I guess the way the thinking went was that if you want to keep MONEY! as MONEY! when you round it, all types should act that way.

I think the relationship between INTEGER! and DECIMAL!, which lack decoration, suggests something more intimate where the type can be lost.  If you don&#39;t want to lose it, ROUND:TO 1.0

    &gt;&gt; round 1.5
    == 2
 
    &gt;&gt; round:to 1.5 1
    == 2

    &gt;&gt; round:to 1.5 1.0
    == 2.0

## BLANK! Pretty Much Has To Mean Empty

If we&#39;re talking about equivalencies, we now know this:

    &gt;&gt; for-each &#39;x _ [print &quot;Doesn&#39;t run&quot;]
    == ~void~  ; anti

    &gt;&gt; empty? _
    == ~okay~  ; anti

And so really, it seems that the TO conversion of BLANK! has only one set of answers to fit into the family of reversibility:

    &gt;&gt; to block! _
    == []

    &gt;&gt; to text! _
    == &quot;&quot;

    &gt;&gt; to blank! &lt;&gt;
    == _

    &gt;&gt; to blank! #{}
    == _

And if you try to TO BLANK! anything that&#39;s not conceptually empty, you&#39;d get an error.

    &gt;&gt; to blank! &lt;a&gt;
    ** Error: ...

I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s a motivating case for saying **to integer! _** should pick something like 0 as an answer, though Rebol2 did something of that sort:

    rebol2&gt;&gt; to integer! none
    == 0

Neither Red nor R3-Alpha carried that forward, [though it was discussed](https://github.com/metaeducation/rebol-issues/issues/1018)

## Can Be Checked In The Implementation

I&#39;ve started hacking this through, and it&#39;s gone relatively well.  TO dispatches ***to the type it&#39;s converting from***, with the type being converted to as the argument.

And it&#39;s nice in the sense that the TO native driving the process can also check the reversibility constraint in the debug build, to give it some teeth.

*(I&#39;ve rigged up some interesting frame mechanics to enable doing this reversal efficiently, that have sped up other parts of the system (like CASCADE) with &quot;downlevel shifting&quot;, that can bypass a trampoline bounce...)*

Anyway, things are a mess right now with a couple hundred broken tests to painfully sift through.  But I think the reversibility rule is good... biggest questions are whether that relaxes in terms of spacing...

    &gt;&gt; to block! &quot;  1    2  &quot;
    == [1 2]  ; legal?

This would suggest you would have to compare with the trimmed/canonized version of your input.

Also, issues of string representations.

    &gt;&gt; b: to block! &quot;--{1}--&quot;
    == [&quot;1&quot;]  ; legal?

So there are some pain points, but chipping away at them.</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>So as a first cut of getting family of equivalencies and reversibility, I wound up with something like this:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; to path! [a.b c.d]
== a.b/c.d  ; what we have "assumed" from history

&gt;&gt; to block! 'a.b/c.d
== [a.b c.d]  ; add in reversibility requirement

&gt;&gt; to text! [a.b c.d]
== "a.b c.d"

&gt;&gt; to path! "a.b c.d"
== a.b/c.d  ; being consistent within the equivalencies
</code></pre>
<p>This was making it a given that TO PATH! of a BLOCK! of items would item-wise join the things into a path.</p>
<p>When you turn the crank with the other rules about reversible transformations and equivalencies, that's just what you get.</p>
<p>BUT if all string classes act equivalently, then it breaks a behavior that was relied upon pretty heavily:</p>
<pre><code> &gt;&gt; to file! 'foo/baz.bar
 == %"foo baz.bar"  ; historical code was expecting %foo/baz.bar
</code></pre>
<p>It's a pretty uphill argument to say that's good.</p>
<h3><a name="p-7893-in-order-to-maintain-the-equivalencies-i-am-promoting-and-fix-this-i-think-we-have-to-push-away-from-the-idea-that-to-is-the-tool-you-reach-for-to-make-sequences-from-blocks-1" class="anchor" href="https://rebol.metaeducation.com#p-7893-in-order-to-maintain-the-equivalencies-i-am-promoting-and-fix-this-i-think-we-have-to-push-away-from-the-idea-that-to-is-the-tool-you-reach-for-to-make-sequences-from-blocks-1"></a>In order to maintain the equivalencies I am promoting, and fix this, I think we have to push away from the idea that TO is the tool you reach for to make sequences from blocks.</h3>
<p>It forces our hand to:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; to block! 'a.b/c.d
== [a.b/c.d]

&gt;&gt; to path! [a.b/c.d]
== a.b/c.d
</code></pre>
<p>But as I've tried to explain, these are useful things--more than was realized.</p>
<p>And all is not lost...and arguably improved...because we have JOIN.  Right now I'm suggesting it would come in two varieties... reducing and non-reducing, based on whether you use a <strong><code>[...]</code></strong> or <strong><code>@[...]</code></strong></p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; join path! ['a.b 'c.d]
== a.b/c.d

&gt;&gt; join path! @[a.b c.d]
== a.b/c.d

&gt;&gt; block: [a.b c.d]

&gt;&gt; inert block
== @[a.b c.d]

&gt;&gt; join path! inert block
== a.b/c.d
</code></pre>
<p>So there's some flexibility there.</p>
<h3><a name="p-7893-this-continues-to-shake-the-foundations-of-what-we-might-have-thought-we-knew-about-to-but-it-feels-like-a-path-of-improvement-2" class="anchor" href="https://rebol.metaeducation.com#p-7893-this-continues-to-shake-the-foundations-of-what-we-might-have-thought-we-knew-about-to-but-it-feels-like-a-path-of-improvement-2"></a>This continues to shake the foundations of what we might have thought we knew about TO, but it feels like a path of improvement.</h3>
<p>Honestly, isn't JOIN clearer than TO, in terms of telling you what's going on?</p>
