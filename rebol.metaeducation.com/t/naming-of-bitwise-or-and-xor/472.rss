    <title>Naming of bitwise OR, AND, XOR</title>
    <link>https://rebol.metaeducation.com/t/naming-of-bitwise-or-and-xor/472</link>
    <description>The plain words OR and AND (and XOR, NOR, etc) were frequently desired to be made &quot;conditional&quot;:

[CureCode 1879: Conditional Operators](https://github.com/rebol/rebol-issues/issues/1879)

Early on, Ren-C implemented this...as well as the notion that the prefix forms would be the behavior of INTERSECT, UNION, etc.  (Then much later, it went down the path of [how exactly to handle short-circuiting](https://github.com/rebol/rebol-issues/issues/1879#issuecomment-354865401), which is its own topic...and it&#39;s why you have to parenthesize the second argument of AND and OR.)

But the question came up of what to name the infix bitwise operations.  What were chosen were `or+` and `and*`...which were allusions to the symbols for the operations used in boolean arithmetic:

https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/textbook/digital/chpt-7/boolean-arithmetic/

But since that early decision, `*` has taken on a kind of special meaning...what one might often think of as &quot;/ONLY&quot; or the more &quot;core&quot; or fundamental version of an operation.  (e.g. `select [a 10 b 20] &#39;c` gives back a BLANK! for convenience, even though that is conflated with `select [a 10 b 20 c _]`.  It is built on top of `select*` which would give a void in the first case, and a blank in the second.)

    select: redescribe [
        {Variant of SELECT* that returns BLANK when not found, instead of void}
    ](
        chain [:select* | :to-value]
    )

This usage of `*` has become so pervasive in the naming scheme, that it makes `and*` seem misleading.

Hence I think `or+` and `and+` may be a better choice to say &quot;the bitwise mathy or&quot; and &quot;the bitwise mathy and&quot;, rather than bow to this kind-of-obscure use of symbolism from boolean math.

Haven&#39;t changed it just yet, but plan to, unless anyone has better ideas.</description>

<p>One of the goals of the change is that essentially:</p>
<pre><code> and+: infix tighten :intersect
 or+: infix tighten :union
 xor+: infix tighten :difference
</code></pre>
<p>That is to say that these operations are the <em>abstract</em> mathematical concepts, like DIFFERENCE is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_difference">Symmetric Difference</a>. When applied to scalar numbers, there's no real other interpretation other than to think you mean it bitwise.  But they're not constrained to that, they work on sets too...</p>
<pre><code> &gt;&gt; [a b c e g] and+ [b e f]
 == [b e]
</code></pre>
<p>So putting "bit" in the name would suggest it's more limited than it is.</p>
<p>For the moment I'm just switching <code>AND*</code> to <code>AND+</code>, but going ahead and getting the intended change committed, so the issues related to moving plain AND and OR to being conditional can march forward.  <em>(And killing the definitely-badly-named AND~, OR~, XOR~.)</em>  By all means, people can keep thinking about the relevant issues.</p>

<p>I actually quite like this, it helps you figure out the logic as you read it, but I see your point about <code>*</code> being used elsewhere.</p>
<p><code>+</code> makes the most sense to me, to give it a "mathy" look. I think all other characters have either been ruled out (here and in that ticket) or don't give it that "mathy" feeling.</p>
<p>What about a different word? I think I still like <code>+</code> better, but throwing this out here ...</p>

<p>We've discussed allowing escaping in WORD!, e.g. <strong>spaces^-between</strong> <em>(I'm an advocate for <code>^-</code> being space instead of tab, else it would be <code>^_</code>)</em>, which would take away caret as a simple word character.</p>

<p>I'm still partial to moving to <code>&amp;</code> for something, possibly characters to line up with <a href="https://dev.w3.org/html5/html-author/charref">HTML entities</a>.  It's an ugly word character, and this would help with the extreme overloading of meanings for <span class="hashtag-raw">#:</span></p>
