    <title>TWEAK, PEEK, POKE, PICK... ?</title>
    <link>https://rebol.metaeducation.com/t/tweak-peek-poke-pick/2485</link>
    <description>The Rosetta stone of GET and SET has come together, based on operations that speak in what I call &quot;dual representation&quot;.

For the moment, let&#39;s just say the baseline function you can use to operate on variables called TWEAK.  If you pass TWEAK a lifted value, it acts just like a SET to that value:

    &gt;&gt; tweak $x lift 1020
    == &#39;1020

    &gt;&gt; x
    == 1020

    &gt;&gt; tweak $x lift null
    == ~null~

    &gt;&gt; x
    == \~null~\  ; antiform

But then there&#39;s the &quot;unlifted range&quot; of values.  What those do is a work in progress, but use your imagination... e.g. it could be a GETTER function:

    &gt;&gt; tweak $x does [print &quot;HI!&quot; 10 + 10]
    == \~&amp;[frame! ...]~\  ; antiform

    &gt;&gt; x
    HI!
    == 20

    &gt;&gt; type of get $x
    HI!
    == \~{integer!}~\  ; antiform  &lt;-- e.g. GET doesn&#39;t see it as an ACTION!

## But How Do You &quot;PEEK&quot; a &quot;TWEAK&quot;?

Right now, the trick is that if you pass TWEAK a NULL, then it interprets that as a query of what the state is:

    &gt;&gt; tweak $x lift 1020
    == &#39;1020

    &gt;&gt; tweak $x null
    == &#39;1020

But it would be nice if that had a nicer name.  I kind of like PEEK... because of its history of letting you look into the secrets of arbitrary magical memory locations from BASIC (e.g. on a Commodore 64)

Yet in that worldview, PEEK complements POKE... and POKE is an established Rebolism that&#39;s &quot;not magical&quot;... e.g. it doesn&#39;t work in the lifted range... and is a complement to PICK.

## Could POKE Be Reclaimed For The &quot;Tweaky Magic?&quot;

:thinking:

POKE is a nicer name than TWEAK, and pairs nicely with PEEK.

PICK might be complemented by something else...?  PUT, maybe?

As a refresher: in Ren-C&#39;s model, you don&#39;t technically *need* PICK or POKE, since:

* `pick x y` =&gt; `x.(y)`
* `poke x y z` =&gt; `x.(y): z`

But their existence helps in various cases, e.g. `first: specialize pick/ [1]` or something like that.

## Thinking About It...

For now I&#39;m just using TWEAK to NULL for &quot;peeking&quot; and not giving it a name yet.  But, thoughts welcome...</description>
