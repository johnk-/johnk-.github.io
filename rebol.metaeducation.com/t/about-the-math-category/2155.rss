    <description>Rebol languages aren&#39;t a particularly great choice for math.

* Operator precedence follows the left-to-right nature of the evaluator, not the precedence many would expect:

      &gt;&gt; 1 + 2 * 3
      == 9

* Its syntax focus on words-separated-by-spaces, so this expands out expressions:

      &gt;&gt; length of [x+y*z]
      == 1

      &gt;&gt; type of first [x+y*z]
      == &amp;[word]

* The language is interpreted, meaning that even the simplest operation like **add 1 2** will run thousands of times slower than a compiled instruction.
