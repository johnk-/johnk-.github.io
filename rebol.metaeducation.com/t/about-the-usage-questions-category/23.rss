    <description>Everybody is new to Rebol at some point. Whether you are struggling with the installation or you just can&#39;t figure out why you are not seeing the performance everybody else seems to be talking about.

To make helping you easy, explain what you are planning to do and how you are currently doing. Post some code (a minimal reproducible example).

A lot of questions have already been answered so make sure you searched this forum and [StackOverflow&#39;s using Redbol tags](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rebol+or+rebol2+or+rebol3+or+red) first.</description>
