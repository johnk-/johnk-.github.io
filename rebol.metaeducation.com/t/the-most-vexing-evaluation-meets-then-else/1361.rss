    <title>The Most Vexing Evaluation: -&gt; meets THEN/ELSE</title>
    <link>https://rebol.metaeducation.com/t/the-most-vexing-evaluation-meets-then-else/1361</link>
    <description>Whenever the evaluator code gets churned around, there are a few things that break first.

One of the most frequent nightmares is having to fix the mixture of arrows and then/else.  Here&#39;s the working behavior:

    &gt;&gt; if 1 &lt; 2 [&lt;branch&gt;] then x -&gt; [print [&quot;THEN&quot; x]] else [print &quot;ELSE&quot;]
    THEN &lt;branch&gt;

    &gt;&gt; if 1 &gt; 2 [&lt;branch&gt;] then x -&gt; [print [&quot;THEN&quot; x]] else [print &quot;ELSE&quot;]
    ELSE

**This is a showpiece of composition.**  It&#39;s one of the things that I want people to encounter and go &quot;wow&quot; when they see how it&#39;s being done.  So letting it break is not an option.

## What Typically Breaks

When it goes south, what happens is the ELSE won&#39;t run.

We want the precedence to work out as if you had written this:

    ((if null [&lt;branch&gt;]) then (x -&gt; [print [&quot;THEN&quot; x]])) else [print &quot;ELSE&quot;]

So when the THEN goes to get its branch argument, it gets the function constructed from the arrow *but stops there*...deferring the ELSE.  The THEN runs, and the ELSE acts on the completed output of the entire IF..THEN expression.

Instead, when this breaks, the typical broken interpretation is:

    (if null [&lt;branch&gt;]) then ((x -&gt; [print [&quot;THEN&quot; x]]) else [print &quot;ELSE&quot;])

Here we see that THEN went to get its branch argument of the arrow.  But the arrow--once constructed--is passed as the first argument to ELSE, and the ELSE runs.  Since the arrow isn&#39;t void or null, the ELSE evaluates to that arrow...which the THEN runs.  If the THEN gets void or null as input it doesn&#39;t run, and now considers itself the end of the chain...since the ELSE ran prematurely.

## Why Does It Break?

Remember that THEN and ELSE are &quot;INFIX:DEFER operations&quot;.  This is to say that they don&#39;t greedily take the first opportunity to run as infix (the way something like **`+`** does).  Instead, they pass on that first opportunity...and run on the *second* opportunity.

Consider that if ELSE ran on its first infix opportunity, it would be pointless:

     if null [print &quot;not run&quot;] else [print &quot;run&quot;]

The first time ELSE gets seen by the evaluator is while it&#39;s putting the `[print &quot;not run&quot;]` argument into IF&#39;s branch argument slot.  If it ran at that moment, you&#39;d have:

    if null ([print &quot;not run&quot;] else [print &quot;run&quot;])

The ELSE would have a block on its left that wasn&#39;t void, and evaluate to that.  So this would act the same as:

    if null [print &quot;not run&quot;]

So now back to our broken situation:

    if false [&lt;branch&gt;] then x -&gt; [print [&quot;THEN&quot; x]] else [print &quot;ELSE&quot;]

**ELSE will only defer *once***.  Which means it should only be &quot;seen&quot; twice.  When it breaks it gets seen *three* times:

1. It gets seen while `-&gt;` is fulfilling `[print [&quot;THEN&quot; x]]` into its second argument, and does a lookahead.
2. It gets seen after THEN fulfills its argument
3. It gets seen after THEN executes

We definitely want the second time ELSE is seen--when it executes--to be at (3).  But which of (1) or (2) is the right &quot;first&quot; time to see ELSE?  Both can&#39;t happen...but one of them has to happen.

## A Case Of Conflicting Requirements for Lookahead

We know that `1 + 2 * 3` is 9 and not 7.   So the first time `*` gets a chance to be looked-ahead-at is *after* the `1 + 2` infix is finished.

If we looked only at this rule, it would suggest (1) is the &quot;bad&quot; time for ELSE to be &quot;seen&quot;.  `-&gt;` is infix like `+` is, and ELSE is infix like `*` is.  So we might see an analogy:

* `1 + 2 * 3` =&gt; `(1 + 2) * 3`
* `x -&gt; [...] else [...]` =&gt; `(x -&gt; [...]) else [...]`

But if infix operators don&#39;t look ahead in their argument fulfillment, why would the `-&gt;` have been seen during the THEN?  Why wouldn&#39;t it be:

    ((if null [&lt;branch&gt;] then x) -&gt; [print [&quot;THEN&quot; x]]) else [print &quot;ELSE&quot;]

It looks like we pretty much have to gerrymander this so that something about the properties of the parts get the desired outcome.

## Something Has To Bend

The easiest-seeming option is: **Quoted lookbacks like the one done by -&gt; supersede the &quot;no lookahead&quot; rule**.

&gt; **UPDATE:** See also: https://rebol.metaeducation.com/t/implicit-escaping-to-tiebreak-literal-arguments/2290

That would mean you get this:

    &gt;&gt; 1 + 2 * 3
    == 9  ; `*` is not left literal

    &gt;&gt; left-literal-multiplier: infix func [@left right] [
           print [&quot;left-literal-multiplier&quot; left right]
           left * right
       ]

    &gt;&gt; 1 + 2 left-literal-multiplier 3
    left-literal-multiplier 2 3
    == 7  ; what happens when you take the argument literally

I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the *best* rule.  But it doesn&#39;t seem to come into conflict with any of the crazy examples I&#39;ve come up with yet.  *(And I try a fair number of &quot;crazy&quot; things.)*

I&#39;m patching the latest breakage of this behavior, and I&#39;m kind of sure it will probably break again.  But I wanted to have a reference to why this seems to work by taking away the &quot;(1)&quot; case.

A key point I want to make here is that since we&#39;ve gotten this far with it, *I&#39;m not foreseeing accepting any designs which don&#39;t allow this to work*.</description>
