    <title>Why Doesn&#39;t PRINT Return VOID?</title>
    <link>https://rebol.metaeducation.com/t/why-doesnt-print-return-void/1466</link>
    <description>Since PRINT doesn&#39;t have an interesting return value, we might ask what the harm would be in making it return VOID...

## Canonizing VOID Has Misleading Opt-Out Properties

The evolution of void results is such that it&#39;s part of the void-in-null-out strategy, as well a way of doing things like opting out of an APPEND without raising an error.

So consider this:

    &gt;&gt; if 10 &gt; 20 [&lt;d&gt;] else []
    == ~[]~  ; anti (void)

    &gt;&gt; if 10 &lt; 20 [&lt;d&gt;]
    == &lt;d&gt;

    &gt;&gt; append [a b c] if 10 &gt; 20 [&lt;d&gt;] else []
    == [a b c]

    &gt;&gt; append [a b c] if 10 &lt; 20 [&lt;d&gt;] else []
    == [a b c &lt;d&gt;]

*That feels like a purposeful application of a void state.*  But if we were to say that PRINT returned void, we&#39;d be condoning things like:

    &gt;&gt; append [a b c] print &quot;does this seem right?&quot;
    does this seem right?
    == [a b c]

Somehow a function with an *uninteresting* result has been elevated to one that people might start assuming has an *interesting, void result*.  It seems to me that having PRINT return an &quot;ornery&quot; value is a safer and saner strategy:

    &gt;&gt; trash? print &quot;this makes more sense&quot;
    this makes more sense
    == ~okay~  ; anti

    &gt;&gt; append [a b c] print &quot;I like this error&quot;
    I like this error
    ** Error: APPEND does not accept ~ antiform for its VALUE argument

## General Argument: Limiting Interface Flexibility

Let&#39;s generalize the question to SOME-FUNCTION where the key point is that at the time you write it, you haven&#39;t thought of a meaningful result for it.

If at the time of writing a function you know that it doesn&#39;t have a meaningful return value, then making it return void--instead of returning a nothing value--ties your hands in changing it.

People will start writing things like:

    all [
        ...
        some-function ...  ; user assumes no effect, because of void
        ...
    ]

But if SOME-FUNCTION had returned a TRASH value, then they could have gotten the same effect more obviously with:

    all [
        ...
        elide some-function ...
        ...
    ]

This also gives more freedom to change the interface later, if you think of an interesting value to return.  You can progressively add more return types after the fact.  But once people assume you always return VOID, this trap will happen...you&#39;re locked in forever in a way that was pretty much completely a-void-able.</description>

<p>I'm not sure why PRINT returns a ~ antiform, and wonder if it wouldn't be better to have it be silent like ELIDE?</p>

</aside>
<p><strong>Circa 2025, it's now fully decided that <a href="https://rebol.metaeducation.com/t/console-treatment-of-void-vs-trash/2045">the ~ antiform (TRASH) does not display in the console</a></strong></p>
<p>So that's at least one good reason, because ELIDE returns a GHOST!... and  whether the console chooses to UNGHOST that into a VOID or leave it as is, you'd get something displayed after your PRINT.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; print "No matter what, you'd see *something*"
No matter what, you'd see *something*
== ~,~  ; anti (ghost)
</code></pre>
<p>But more generally, do you want this?</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; append [a b c] spread [d e], print "Done."
Done
== [a b c d e]
</code></pre>
<p>Whatever arbitrary thing you had before the PRINT would leak through.</p>

<p>For some, how they want to use the word PRINT may be universal enough that they would rather it be fully invisible.  But that would involve a very specific understanding of a very common function...similar to how <strong>elide</strong> and <strong>comment</strong> and <strong>assert</strong> and <strong>--</strong> are known to have no result.</p>
<p>All you need to do in your "skin" library is this:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; print: chain [lib.print/ elide/]
== ~#[frame! {print} [line]]~  ; anti

&gt;&gt; 1 + 2 print "That's it."
That's it.
== 3
</code></pre>
<p>But I don't think the average "no meaningful result" function fits in this category, and I'd say I'm fairly skeptical if PRINT belongs in it.</p>
<p>You can try it out, but I don't think you'll like it.  <img src="https://rebol.metaeducation.com/images/emoji/twitter/person_shrugging.png?v=14" title=":person_shrugging:" class="emoji" alt=":person_shrugging:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>

            <p>On a tangential note: I'm not sure why PRINT returns a <strong><code>~</code></strong> antiform, and wonder if it wouldn't be better to have it be silent like ELIDE? Would that create havoc if new users did confuse its usage?</p>
