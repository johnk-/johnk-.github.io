    <title>Renaming MAP! to DICTIONARY!</title>
    <link>https://rebol.metaeducation.com/t/renaming-map-to-dictionary/1856</link>
    <description>Rebol&#39;s historical leaning was to give things &quot;plain names&quot;, even when that ran counter to computing tradition.

(For instance DECIMAL! was called that instead of what it really was... a FLOAT!, because &quot;floating point&quot; is too techie a concept.  Yet &quot;decimal&quot; means a different type of numeric representation underlying the math.  Red reversed this decision, and calls floating point numbers FLOAT!)

**There has been rough consensus that MAP should be a verb, for applying an operation across a data structure.**

To recap, with Ren-C&#39;s concept of generators, we could make a generator called EACH

    &gt;&gt; gen: each [1 2]

    &gt;&gt; gen
    == 1

    &gt;&gt; gen
    == 2

    &gt;&gt; gen
    ; null

And then we&#39;ve talked about how FOR would call the generator repeatedly until it hit NULL, returning the last body result:

    &gt;&gt; for x each [1 2] [print [x], x * 10]
    1
    2
    == 20

So MAP has been suggested as being the version that collects the body results as you go:

    &gt;&gt; map x each [1 2] [print [x], x * 10]
    == [10 20]

Seems pretty neat and composable, huh?

But this makes it feel like calling a datatype MAP! just muddles things.

DICTIONARY! is a bit long to write out, but... people seemed to tolerate &quot;refinement&quot;.  Same number of letters (and wider in a non-fixed width font...)

    DICTIONARY!
    REFINEMENT!

   DICTIONARY
   REFINEMENT

...so dictionary doesn&#39;t really seem so bad, if you ask me.</description>
