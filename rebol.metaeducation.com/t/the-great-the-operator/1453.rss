    <title>The Great THE Operator!</title>
    <link>https://rebol.metaeducation.com/t/the-great-the-operator/1453</link>
    <description>In Ren-C, THE is a really well-named choice for something that evaluates literally to its argument:

    &gt;&gt; the word
    == word

    &gt;&gt; the (1 + 2)
    == (1 + 2)

Historical Redbol called that &quot;quote&quot;.  But in Ren-C, QUOTE means something altogether different... it means *add a generalized quoting level* to the *evaluated* argument:

    &gt;&gt; quote 10
    == &#39;10

    &gt;&gt; x: 10

    &gt;&gt; quote x
    == &#39;10

    &gt;&gt; quote x + 20
    == &#39;30

    &gt;&gt; quote quote x
    == &#39;&#39;10

    &gt;&gt; quote/depth [a block] 3
    == &#39;&#39;&#39;[a block]

I can&#39;t think of a better name for that than QUOTE!

*(Note: I had thought the name wouldn&#39;t matter that much since generic quoting would mean you&#39;d nearly never use it.  However, [quoting has other effects](https://rebol.metaeducation.com/t/the-beta-one-mutability-manifesto/1062/4?u=hostilefork) which means we probably want to encourage people not to use evaluative quoting of GROUP!s/etc. unless they are sure they know what they&#39;re doing...)*


## For History Buffs: the Excruciating Long Path to Picking THE

In retrospect, THE seems great and short (and obvious?) for generating a literal value.  But when QUOTE had been ruled out, it was actually a bumpy naming road across a bunch of not great options.

First there was LITERAL:

    &gt;&gt; literal x
    == x

But when you give an operation a noun name, then it competes with when you might want a variable to hold that.  So if you have a list of &quot;literals&quot; you might say **for-each literal literals [...]**.  I had an idea to work around this by calling it LITERALLY:

    &gt;&gt; literally x
    == x

But both LITERAL and LITERALLY feel too long, so it was abbreviated as LIT:
 
    &gt;&gt; lit x
    == x

The word JUST came up for another application, but its brevity made it feel like it might be a fit.  But once THE came on the scene, it was the better choice...freeing up JUST for what it was meant to do in the first place!</description>
