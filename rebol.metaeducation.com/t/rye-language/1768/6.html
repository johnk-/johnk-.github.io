              <p>Thanks for the heads-up.  Having my morning caffeine and so I guess I can briefly look at this.  But before I can make any sense of the GUI, I need to survey the language a bit.</p>
<h2><a name="p-7770-three-list-types-1" class="anchor" href="6.html#p-7770-three-list-types-1"></a>Three List Types?</h2>
<p>It looks like Rye has <code>{...}</code> which it has called a "block".  And despite not being present in any of the examples it presumably has <code>(...)</code>.  But the GUI examples also show use of <code>[...]</code>.</p>
<p>I can't find what it calls the bracketed form--the web page is not super informative.  The web console crashes on nearly every example, and pretty much anything I type.  Going to look at the source...</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/refaktor/rye/blob/625283fd05334a293889cf803b8c0daed48103a9/loader/loader.go#L436">Okay here we go.</a></strong></p>
<p><code>[...]</code> is apparently a BBLOCK.  <img src="../../../images/emoji/twitter/man_facepalming.png%3Fv=14" title=":man_facepalming:" class="emoji" alt=":man_facepalming:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20">  Bad naming, but at least he calls <code>(...)</code> GROUP.</p>
<p>Ren-C wins here with <strong><code>[block]</code> <code>•</code> <code>(group)</code> <code>•</code> <code>{fence}</code></strong></p>
<p><strong>BUT</strong> since all three types exist, it does mean the GUI has more parts.  So maybe there will be some ideas about how to leverage that to borrow from.</p>
<p>(I can guess why <code>{...}</code> was likely chosen as the basic inert type... to look more appealing to Go programmers.  But I'm not sure that's a win--standing out is better to know when you're switching languages.  Certainly would have been nice to call that a FENCE instead of a BLOCK.)</p>
<h2><a name="p-7770-falsey-zeros-2" class="anchor" href="6.html#p-7770-falsey-zeros-2"></a>Falsey Zeros</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>if 0 { print "Moon" }<br>
; doesn't print anything</p>
</blockquote>
<p>0 being "falsey" breaks the usefulness of ANY and ALL and such, crippling the ability to write idiomatic code:</p>
<pre><code> value: all [&lt;&lt;condition1&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;condition 2&gt;&gt; some-number]
</code></pre>
<p>I can think of a lot of reasons to make it "truthy", and 0 reasons to make it falsey.  If picking things to change about the language I definitely wouldn't change this.</p>
<h2><a name="p-7770-bblock-for-datatypes-no-3" class="anchor" href="6.html#p-7770-bblock-for-datatypes-no-3"></a>BBLOCK For Datatypes?  No...</h2>
<p>I managed to get the console to answer a type question, and it gave back what looked like a "BBLOCK".  So I wondered if Rye had gone to a system like <code>&amp;[type]</code> in Ren-C.</p>
<pre><code>x&gt; type? "abc"
[Word: string]
</code></pre>
<p>But, no.  TYPE? returns a WORD!.  It's just stylizing its output.</p>
<pre><code>x&gt; type? type? "abc"
[Word: word]
</code></pre>
<h2><a name="p-7770-left-set-word-enables-block-as-lightweight-function-4" class="anchor" href="6.html#p-7770-left-set-word-enables-block-as-lightweight-function-4"></a>:LEFT-SET-WORD Enables BLOCK-as-Lightweight-Function</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>You will [see] <em>why</em> later, but Rye also has set-words that take value from the left.</p>
<pre><code>"Jim" :name
12 + 21 :apples + 100 :fruits
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>So <strong><code>"Jim" :name</code></strong> as a synonym for <strong><code>name: "Jim"</code></strong> ?</p>
<p>This is bizarre, but I dug around and found out why:</p>
<pre><code>loop 3 { :i , prns i }    ; loop function injects loop number into the 
                          ; code block and left set-word can pick it up
</code></pre>
<p>So this is Rye's version of <strong><code>repeat 3 i -&gt; [print i]</code></strong>, where in Ren-C you would use a GROUP! generally and it wouldn't come out looking too awful comparatively...same # of characters with his example when put side by side:</p>
<pre><code>repeat 3 { :i , print i }
repeat 3 (i -&gt; [print i])
</code></pre>
<p>I'm not a fan of the <strong><code>:i</code></strong> set-word-from-the-left concept.  But it is true that Ren-C's approach costs you the generation of a fairly lightweight lambda, vs. efficiencies that could be had by using a stylized block directly.</p>
<p>When I've thought of stylizing blocks, I've never thought of "leading GET-WORD!s".  I threw around ideas more like:</p>
<pre><code>repeat 3 [[i] print i]
repeat 3 [i | print i]
</code></pre>
<p>Though these days we could glue the variables onto the block with a sequence?</p>
<pre><code>repeat 3 i:[print i]

for each [1 2 3 4] [a b]:[
    print ["A is" a]
    print ["B is" b]
]
</code></pre>
<p>It's ugly...but I don't find it as ugly as Rye's method, and still gets the variables with the block in one slot without creating a function...if that is a goal.</p>
<p>With EACH and such aiming to become generators, this does cut at the heart of some questions about whether we would want:</p>
<pre><code>for each [1 2 3] ... code and possibly var go here ...
for var each [1 2 3] ... code goes here ...
for-each var [1 2 3] ... code goes here ...
</code></pre>
<p>Ren-C's approach here just comes out looking better to me:</p>
<pre><code>for [a b] each [1 2 3 4] [
    print ["A is" a]
    print ["B is" b]
]

for-each [a b] [1 2 3 4] [  ; legacy wrapper, maybe in the box, maybe not
    print ["A is" a]
    print ["B is" b]
]
</code></pre>
<p>You get a variable-naming slot you might not need:</p>
<pre><code>handler: [a b] -&gt; [
    print ["A is" a]
    print ["B is" b]
]

for # each [1 2 3 4] handler/
</code></pre>
<p>But I feel like I can live with that, especially since you might want to use the slot as a filter spec for what to pass...even if you don't need to name things:</p>
<pre><code>handler: [b] -&gt; [
    print ["B is" b]
]

for [_ #] each [1 2 3 4] handler/
; prints 2, 4
</code></pre>
<p>Anyway... status quo wins here for me.</p>
<h2><a name="p-7770-failures-vs-errors-5" class="anchor" href="6.html#p-7770-failures-vs-errors-5"></a>Failures vs. Errors</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Failures can be [handled], code errors can only be fixed</em><br>
Rye distinguishes between a failure of a function to produce a result, which can be handled nicely, without breaking a flow. Or a code Error, which means an unknown state, so the program should generally stop and Error should be fixed in code. An unhandled failure is also a code Error.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So this sounds on the surface like it may arise from an understanding that reacting to abrupt errors is a bad idea, and you can only handle error conditions at the boundary between caller and callee.</p>
<p>But there is nothing in the <a href="https://ryelang.org/meet_rye/safety/failures_errors/">Failures and Errors</a> section  <img src="../../../images/emoji/twitter/man_shrugging.png%3Fv=14" title=":man_shrugging:" class="emoji" alt=":man_shrugging:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
<p>I'd be very surprised if it scratches the surface of what <a href="../../fail-vs-return-raise-the-new-age-of-definitional-errors/1852.html">definitional errors</a> are doing.</p>
<h2><a name="p-7770-context-paths-6" class="anchor" href="6.html#p-7770-context-paths-6"></a>"Context Paths"</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>We can use a <strong>context path</strong>, another literal value type in Rye, to address values inside a context. Evaluator uses <em>cpath</em> in the same manner as it uses words. If a word in a context is bound to a function it evaluates it, if not it returns the value bound to it.</p>
<pre><code>print pos-printer/codepage
; prints: w1250
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>So he uses backslashes for refinements, and forward slashes for picking things out of contexts.  It's almost like the <strong><code>:</code></strong> for CHAIN! refinement vs. <strong><code>.</code></strong> for TUPLE! picking distinction.</p>
<p>Of course I think Ren-C's decisions are superior here.  But notable that refinements and member selection are done with different "path" (sequence) types.</p>
<h2><a name="p-7770-context-protection-7" class="anchor" href="6.html#p-7770-context-protection-7"></a>Context Protection</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>No direct changes</em></p>
<p>We can’t use the equivalent of <strong>set</strong> or <strong>mod-words</strong>, to change the values inside a context. If you come from Rebol, this is possible there, but Rye tries to keep a much tighter control on modification in general. Rye only allows direct changes in the current context, but not in sub-contexts and not in the parent contexts. You can only <em>send messages</em> i.e. make function calls there.</p>
<p>What you can do, is “send messages” to other contexts, that means “call functions” there. But in Rye a limited number of functions that change values in-place (hence can change state) need to end with “!” (exclamation mark), so the calls to such modifying functions are visible and explicit.</p>
<pre><code>count: 0
; prints: 100

actuator: context { loop 100 { inc! 'count } }

reseter: context { change! 0 'count |if { print "Changed!" } }

print count
; prints: 0
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>That is pretty heavy-handed.</p>
<p>I'm sure there's usefulness to a policy of controlling access, and saying only some kinds of references can mutate some fields.  Definitely worth thinking about, but even as a C++ programmer who believes in abstraction, I think "if a struct will work, use a struct".  There are different granularities of concerns.</p>
<p>I get mad when people look at small Ren-C examples that look awkward and miss the bigger picture, so I don't want to do that here...but...initial impression, I don't think this is a way I would want to be <em>forced</em> to work.</p>
<h2><a name="p-7770-rye-dialect-8" class="anchor" href="6.html#p-7770-rye-dialect-8"></a>Rye Dialect</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Do</code> is a general Rye function that <em>does</em> the Rye dialect. A</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'll just point out that Carl was adamant that when you write something like <strong><code>for-each 'x [1 2 3] [print [x]]</code></strong> you are not using "the DO dialect" or "the Rebol dialect".</p>
<p>He said that was distinct from dialects, and was "the Rebol language", in which you implement dialects.</p>
<p>In Ren-C, there might now be grounds for something called "the DO dialect"...in terms of what DO does when you pass it a block... which will <em>not</em> be EVAL.   But when you run code, is that the "EVAL dialect?"</p>
<p>I'm certainly not as strongly opinionated on the matter as Carl was.  But in deference, I'm willing to just call it "the evaluator".</p>
<h2><a name="p-7770-extends-object-9" class="anchor" href="6.html#p-7770-extends-object-9"></a>Extends Object</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Function <strong>extends</strong> accepts another context in addition to a block of code and sets the accepted context as a parent to a newly created one.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even though I've long hated <strong><code>make (object) [...]</code></strong> because it put an object instance where a datatype would be, I hadn't really thought of <strong><code>extends (object) [...]</code></strong> as the generalized replacement for that.  Not sure why I haven't replaced it by now.</p>
<p>Think I'm going to follow Rye's lead here.  EXTENDS will be how you extend object, not MAKE.</p>
<p>That's all going to need review in light of how FENCE! winds up being used.  Lots of thought needed there.</p>

<p>Rye is context oriented language, where words get meaning in specific contexts, and we can construct contexts in a way that makes the most sense. In code below context <code>circle</code> isn’t viewed as a subclass of math, but the programmer decided that it makes sense to define context circle with context math as the first parent.</p>
<pre><code>rye .needs { math } ; check if we have math module built-in

circle: extends math { 
     circuference: fn { r } { 2 * pi * r } 
     area: fn { r } { pi * r .sq } 
 }

print circle/area 10
; prints: 314.159265

do\in circle { print circuference 10 }
; prints: 62.831853
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm a bit confused because I saw another example on the homepage...</p>
<pre><code>; Rye like Rebol or Lisp has no operator precedence.
; But it has Math dialect which has it and more.
math { 2 + 2 * sqrt ( 12 + ( 24 / 3 ) ) }
</code></pre>
<p>This makes it look like MATH returns a number.  So EXTENDS would be extending the product of a calculation?</p>
<h2><a name="p-7770-pure-functions-11" class="anchor" href="6.html#p-7770-pure-functions-11"></a>PURE Functions</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>If you <strong>probe</strong> builtin functions in shell you will see that most of them show something like <code>[Pure BFunction ...]</code>. A function being Pure means that it has no side effects and that it has referential transparency. This means that with the same inputs it will always produce same output.</p>
<p>Function for creating pure function is <strong>pfn</strong>. Pure functions can only call other pure functions (builtin or normal).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I've been meaning to add this (<a href="../../the-typeset-representation-problem/1300.html">first mentioned in 2020</a>).  Especially given that typechecking is done through constraint functions.  We don't want to do a typecheck...have a value pass the check and then be marked as not needing to be typechecked again...and then have the function return a different result for the same input on the next call.  (The word bindings in the typecheck block also have to be permanent/hardened.)</p>
<p>There's just been bigger fish to fry.  But when I did make it, it wouldn't be a special generator.  I would just write it as <strong><code>x: pure func [...] [...]</code></strong>.  I wasn't thinking of it as a property of the function... but rather a property of the reference.</p>
<p>The thing is--we can't pre-emptively analyze a function to know if it's pure or impure--we can only catch it when it tries to do something impure.  Given that reality, why not let you exploit your knowledge that a given parameterization of a function is pure?  It might only be impure when you call it in certain ways.</p>
<p>Or maybe the person who wrote EVEN? forgot to make it pure, but it was:</p>
<pre><code> &gt;&gt; run pure even?/ 10
 == ~okay~  ; anti
</code></pre>
<p>That might be fine enough for when it came up, but PURE might even be one of these tricky "I interpret my CHAIN!" functions, so you can modify the call:</p>
<pre><code> &gt;&gt; pure:even? 10
 == ~okay~  ; anti
</code></pre>
<p>Then IMPURE could let you switch out of pure mode to do impure things.</p>
<pre><code>impure [print "Logging!", append log [a b c]]
</code></pre>
<p>Seems very fun, just haven't gotten around to it.</p>
<h2><a name="p-7770-bfunction-is-builtin-function-natives-12" class="anchor" href="6.html#p-7770-bfunction-is-builtin-function-natives-12"></a>BFunction Is "Builtin Function" ("Natives")</h2>
<pre><code>probe ?join
prints: [Pure BFunction(1): Joins Block or list of values together]

<p>Just for reference on what that is, in case I see this BFunction term again.</p>
<h2><a name="p-7770-pipe-words-and-op-words-13" class="anchor" href="6.html#p-7770-pipe-words-and-op-words-13"></a>Pipe Words and Op Words</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Now we will call the same functions with the same arguments, but we’ll use op-words instead of regular words. Op-words begin with a dot. In case of an op-word, first argument is taken from the left.</p>
<pre><code>"Call me" .print
; prints: Call me

100 .inc
; returns: 101
</code></pre>
<p>Pipe words behave similarly or in simple cases exactly the same. So you will get the same results in these examples if as we got them with op-words:</p>
<pre><code>"Call me" |print
; prints: Call me

100 |inc
; returns: 101
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Two different ways of saying it, but the pipe word does what Ren-C calls "postponement":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Op-word applies to the first value it can on the left, and pipe-word lets all expressions on the left evaluate and then takes the result as the first argument.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ren-C infix has "normal", "deferred" (one eval step, like THEN and ELSE use), and "postponed" (evaluate entire left hand side).</p>
<p>I would accomplish this desire with an operator:</p>
<pre><code>1 + 2 + 3 |echo  ; what Rye would be like

1 + 2 + 3 |&gt; echo  ; looks fine to me, for cases where I would use this
</code></pre>
<p>This reminds me of why I had <strong><code>|&gt;</code></strong> as a postponing SHOVE operator, it was intended to meet this desire.  I never used it.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@earl</span> always said that he considered infix to be a slight compromise that should not be pushed on too much... that the language was fundamentally prefix.  I've pushed the boundaries a little bit (<strong>type of</strong>), but it seems that Rye has decided that infix to accomplish piping is the mecca.</p>
<p>I've already said my piece on this: I don't think it looks very good, and I certainly wouldn't waste lexical space on two ways to say it.  <a href="https://rebol.metaeducation.com/t/quick-and-dirty-flow-example/2270">I wrote FLOW in a couple of minutes and like it better.</a></p>

<p>Now I know enough that I can read the GUI examples and know what's going on.</p>
<p>It has PURE and three list types, calling <code>(...)</code> GROUP!.  So at least we appear to agree on something.  <img src="../../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png%3Fv=14" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20">  Oh, and EXTENDS too...I need to get rid of MAKE on object! instances.</p>
<p>The context inheritance may warrant a more detailed analysis, but I'd need to build and run it...because the web console just doesn't work.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(The language seems to pop up on Hacker News every so often, I’m not sure why. At least Red has some reason to be posted there.)</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Red hasn't accomplished anything notable in a long time, IMO (besides some of <span class="mention">@hiiamboris</span>'s stuff).  Rye "deserves" to be there as much as anything.</p>
<p>Where Rye has the potential to be most notable--I'd think--is leveraging Go's infrastructure.  Here's some of that:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/refaktor/rye/blob/main/examples/goroutines/channels.rye" class="inline-onebox">rye/examples/goroutines/channels.rye at main · refaktor/rye · GitHub</a></p>
<p>There's also one of the examples in the GUI of using the <code>go</code> keyword to start a goroutine.  So that's probably some of the more interesting stuff to look at.</p>
