    <title>Singular ANY-SPACE vs. Plural WHITESPACE?</title>
    <link>https://rebol.metaeducation.com/t/singular-any-space-vs-plural-whitespace/1828</link>
    <description>Transitions have made some parse rules get longer:

     [any whitespace]  ; being repurposed--seems like &quot;pick one&quot; not a loop construct
     =&gt;
     [while whitespace]  ; being repurposed to arity-2; arity-1 form is unsettling
     =&gt;
     [try some whitespace]

But this seems a bit overlong...especially considering that whitespace is such a long word.

It occurs to me that &quot;whitespace&quot; can be itself plural.  Might we say that ANY-SPACE is a character set, and then **`whitespace: [some any-space]`** ?

This at least gets you down to **`whitespace`** or **`try whitespace`**...which seems pretty minimal for the intent (unless you&#39;re going to go with abbreviations like **`ws*`** or similar).

I really don&#39;t know how many cases there are where you are willing to tolerate only a single unit of an arbitrary whitespace character.  When does that come up?  Usually if you&#39;re matching a single whitespace character you know which one you&#39;re reacting to...and the only time you&#39;d ever bundle up a collection of them together is when you&#39;re willing to skip a lot of it.

I doubt there&#39;d be many uses of ANY-SPACE in a rule, and that it would just be used to compound other character collections.

It means WHITESPACE would be a parse rule--not a charset--so you would have to use ANY-SPACE for character set in non-PARSE code, but that doesn&#39;t seem so bad.</description>
