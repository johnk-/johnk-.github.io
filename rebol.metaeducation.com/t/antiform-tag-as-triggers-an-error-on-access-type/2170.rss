    <title>Antiform TAG! As &quot;Triggers an Error On Access&quot; Type</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/antiform-tag-as-triggers-an-error-on-access-type/2170</link>
    <description>In the post [&quot;Shades of Distinction In Non-Valued Intents&quot;](https://forum.rebol.info/t/shades-of-distinction-in-non-valued-intents/1604), I had originally written:

[quote=&quot;hostilefork, post:2, topic:2283&quot;]
Eventually the NULL state became the isotopic status of the WORD! null, so a **~null~** antiform.

It joined **~true~** and **~false~** as being antiforms you could test for truthiness and falseyness. But if you were okay with getting an error on conditional testing, any other word could be used:

```
  config: ~initialize-system-not-called~

  initialize-system: func [
      {Let&#39;s say this function reads the config file}
  ][
      ...
      config: [...]
  ]
```

This usually causes a nice labeled message anytime someone tries to use CONFIG:

Going this route would create a pain point for anyone who thought they were going to test for whether you had a config initialized by testing **if config [...]**. So that has to be considered as whether it&#39;s what you want.
[/quote]

I&#39;ve come to question this as things have gone on, to where I&#39;m wondering if all antiform words should be reserved by the system (there are system purposes for the ~end~ antiform, for instance).

A generic &quot;error trigger&quot; might come from something like antiform TAG!, permitting spaces:

    config: ~&lt;INITIALIZE-SYSTEM not called&gt;~

    initialize-system: func [
        {Let&#39;s say this function reads the config file}
    ][
        ...
        config: [...]
    ]

    &gt;&gt; config

<blockquote>
<p>VACANT? could be the category of defaultable things (DEFAULTABLE...?) that subsumes NOTHING, HOLE, and NULL. (Maybe void, too?)</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Turning this around in my mind and thinking about it in practice, I'm starting to think that DEFAULT should not consider anything that wouldn't cause an error on variable access to be "defaultable".</p>
<p>There are some instances where variables are set to NULL and then DEFAULT is used to set them.  But where does it end?  What about VOID?  And now that NULL has taken on the role of canon branch inhibitor, it can be thought of as a value as good as any other for (some) purposes.</p>
<p>I think the existing uses of DEFAULT to fill in NULL--which are few and far between--can be retrofitted to:</p>
<pre><code>if not var [var: expression]

; if you're trying to define an object field, getting the assign out
; of the block may be crucial.
;
var: any [var, expression]  ; save 3 chars, but slightly slower on average
</code></pre>
<p>After all, a null VAR won't generate an error on access.  <em>(One of the nice things about <strong><code>var: default [...]</code></strong> is that beyond just saving on repetition, you don't have to tangle with UNSET?, e.g. <strong><code>if unset? $var [var: ...]</code></strong>)</em></p>
<p>This pares down the number of things we consider "defaultable" to:</p>
<ul>
<li>antiform blank! ("nothing")</li>
<li>antiform tag! (<code>~&lt;name in flux&gt;~</code>)  ; more informative nothing-like signal</li>
<li>antiform parameter! ("unspecialized")   ; required in "unset" FRAME! slots for typechecking</li>
</ul>
<p>Comparison operators require the argument to be SOMETHING?... and right now that means anything that's not nothing.  So you can compare antiform tags and antiform parameters.  Which is probably all right?</p>
<p>Anyway...this meshes in my mind pretty well, and it saves creation of too many similar-sounding categories where the behavior isn't consistent across the category.</p>
<p>I'll have to rework some uses of DEFAULT, but I'm more at ease with this definition that excludes NULL.</p>

            <p>Another suggestion: why not MESSAGE? When you access it, it sends an error message, so just call it by what it does.</p>
<p>Out of the options you listed, I like the phonaesthetics of TOXIC / TAG, but I don’t like the name TOXIC in and of itself. HOLE isn’t a bad choice either.</p>

<p>As per <a class="mention" href="https://forum.rebol.info/u/blackattr">@BlackATTR</a>'s reference to Neverending story "A hole would be <em>something</em>... but this was <em>nothing</em>"</p>
<p>So with antiform tag, it's like you've dug a hole that expects to be filled with a value.</p>

<p>Something about "poison" seems to suggest more of a purposeful thing.  Like you can carry around poison in a bottle.  You can't really carry around a hole.</p>

<p>VACANT? could be the category of defaultable things (DEFAULTABLE...?)  that subsumes NOTHING, HOLE, and NULL.  (Maybe void, too?)</p>
<p>The union of NOTHING and HOLE need something.  A variable in either state could be said to be <strong>undefined? $var</strong>.  The states could be... DARKNESS?</p>
<p>I dunno.  But hole seems like the best choice to me of what I've got so far.</p>

<p>TAG! does feel like the right type for this.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I actually got the original idea for having "named trash" from some scripts <a class="mention" href="https://forum.rebol.info/u/rgchris">@rgchris</a> had where he had configuration in the header of a script, something in the spirit of:</p>
<pre><code>Rebol [
    Title: "Configurable Foo Interface Script"
    DLL-Directory: &lt;directory where FOO.DLL lives&gt;
]

...stuff...

if tag? system.script.header.DLL-Directory [
    fail "Set the DLL-Directory in the header to where FOO.DLL lives"
]
libfoo: make library! system.script.header.DLL-Directory
</code></pre>
<p>I thought <em>"hm, that's an interesting idea, a sort of placeholder...would be better if it errored on accidental access"</em>.</p>
<p>So when TRASH! was initially conceived--prior to isotopes--it was a reified type that started and ended with tilde (actually called BAD-WORD!)</p>
<pre><code> DLL-Directory: ~directory-where-FOO-DLL-lives~
</code></pre>
<p>That does show weaknesses in having to convert the dots and spaces to dashes.  So going back to the original placeholder type of TAG! is an interesting move.</p>
<p>It's tempting to say that the whole category would be called TRASH! and take over that role.  But unfortunately <strong><code>&lt;&gt;</code></strong> is a WORD!, so there'd be no slight-looking <strong>~&lt;&gt;~</strong> trash for unset variables.  It would have to be <strong><code>~&lt;unset&gt;~</code></strong> or something like that, which doesn't have the brevity of <strong>~</strong> that I am very attached to now... though there is a slightness to it which can <em>sometimes</em> be undesirable.</p>
<p>It seems to me that DEFAULT should treat these as unassigned:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; x: ~&lt;some placeholder&gt;~
== ~&lt;some placeholder&gt;~  ; anti

&gt;&gt; x: default [10 + 20]
== 30

&gt;&gt; x
== 30

&gt;&gt; x: default [3 + 4]
== 30
</code></pre>
<p>But does that mean UNSET? should return true, had you asked <strong>unset? 'x</strong> ?</p>
<p>So some issues to sort through here regarding what to call it and how it acts.</p>
