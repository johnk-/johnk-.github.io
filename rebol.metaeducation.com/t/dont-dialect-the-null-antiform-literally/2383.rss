    <title>Don&#39;t Dialect The ~NULL~ Antiform Literally</title>
    <link>https://rebol.metaeducation.com/t/dont-dialect-the-null-antiform-literally/2383</link>
    <description>The [MATCH dialect](https://rebol.metaeducation.com/t/time-to-meet-your-match-dialect/1009) (and its family: TYPECHECK, ENSURE, NON, PROHIBIT) once had a &quot;clever&quot; idea for the use of the NULL antiform in the typeset parameter.

The idea was to use it as a shorthand for checking nulls.  This was most useful for PROHIBIT:

    &gt;&gt; value: null

    &gt;&gt; prohibit null value
    ** Error: PROHIBIT of ~null~ got null

There are now a lot of other ways to say that:

    &gt;&gt; prohibit null?/ value
    ** Error: PROHIBIT of NULL? got null

    &gt;&gt; prohibit [null?] value
    ** Error: PROHIBIT of [null?] got null

    &gt;&gt; prohibit [~null~] value
    ** Error: PROHIBIT of [~null~] got null

Using those, it takes between 2-4 more characters to say it, but...

**...using NULL like this creates unnecessary danger of taking a null value literally!**

    &gt;&gt; typeset: null  ; will assign this later...

    ; but you forget to set it...

    &gt;&gt; prohibit typeset value
    ; check against null, when error was desired

When you understand the real systemic purpose of NULL, you understand you should *not* dialect it this way.

While you should &quot;never say never&quot;, I feel fairly comfortable saying you shouldn&#39;t be dialecting nulls.  It&#39;s a state that means you haven&#39;t got around to setting something yet--but you still want to be able to use casual logic tests to know if it&#39;s set yet.</description>
