    <description>There are currently two ways in which Ren-C is built to WebAssembly:

 * The &quot;ReplPad&quot; in-browser rich console experience.  It provides everything from [docking windows to rich editors](https://forum.rebol.info/t/visual-parse-on-the-web-has-arrived/1837), with the full power of the browser available.  This is built via Emscripten, and integrates with JavaScript.

      *  (See also [Language Bridging](https://forum.rebol.info/c/development/language-bridging) category for discussions of JavaScript integration)

  * As a [WASI blob of .wasm](https://forum.rebol.info/t/ren-c-is-now-on-the-clouds-with-wasi/1854), designed to run cross-platform in Wasm runtimes.

While native builds for Windows/Mac/Linux are still pursued as a necessary part of the further development of Ren-C, these WebAssembly targets are the primary focus of Ren-C&#39;s &quot;deliverables&quot;.</description>
