    <title>Literal Matching with the @ Types In UPARSE</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/literal-matching-with-the-types-in-uparse/1643</link>
    <description>I mentioned that the @ types were slated for use for literal matching.  The most frequent example I have given is:

    &gt;&gt; block: [some &quot;a&quot;]

    &gt;&gt; uparse [[some &quot;a&quot;] [some &quot;a&quot;]] [some @block]
    == [some &quot;a&quot;]  ; success gives result of last matching rule

Works with all types:

    &gt;&gt; num: 1

    &gt;&gt; uparse [1 1 1] [some @num]
    == 1

I didn&#39;t mention things like @(gr o up) but those work too:

    &gt;&gt; uparse [1 1 1] [some @(3 - 2)]
    == 1

**I realized I actually do not know how to write the above two cases in Red or Rebol2.**  You can&#39;t use the number as a plain variable in Red, since it acts as a repeat rule *(UPARSE prohibits that, since it&#39;s a rule that takes an argument, you must use REPEAT for such behavior)*

    red&gt;&gt; num: 1

    red&gt;&gt; parse [1 1 1] [some num]
    *** Script Error: PARSE - invalid rule or usage of rule: 1

Also in Red, I&#39;m not clear on why the following isn&#39;t an error, since the GROUP! product is just discarded:

    red&gt;&gt; parse [1 1 1] [some (3 - 2)]
    == false

This is something that would work in R3-Alpha, but doesn&#39;t in Red or Rebol2:

    red&gt;&gt; parse [1 1 1] [some quote (3 - 2)]
    == false

**Your guess is as good as mine.**  Whatever the answer in their world is, it&#39;s not obvious.  But I think the @ types give a clean answer in UPARSE.

## But What About @[bl o ck] ?

We might say that it means match a block literally:

    &gt;&gt; uparse [[some &quot;a&quot;] [some &quot;a&quot;]] [some @[some &quot;a&quot;]]
    == [some &quot;a&quot;]

This seemed a bit wasteful, since we already have a way to match blocks literally by quoting them:

    &gt;&gt; uparse [[some &quot;a&quot;] [some &quot;a&quot;]] [some &#39;[some &quot;a&quot;]]
    == [some &quot;a&quot;]

But UPARSE has changed the game for why @[...] and [...] can mean different things...because *block rules synthesize values*.  And who&#39;s to say you might not want to match a rule and use its product as the literal thing to match against?

    &gt;&gt; uparse [1 1 1 2] [@[some &#39;10, (10 + 10) | some &#39;1 (1 + 1)]]
    == 2

In other words your rule can match *and* provide an answer for the thing to match next.  We have zero experience with how often that might be useful, but maybe it is?  :man_shrugging:

## Lone @ For Quoting Next Item Literally

I&#39;ve defined **@** to synthesize the value after it:

    &gt;&gt; uparse &quot;a&quot; [collect [keep @ keep, keep &lt;any&gt;]]
    == [keep &quot;a&quot;]

So it&#39;s acting like this:

    &gt;&gt; uparse &quot;a&quot; [collect [keep (&#39;keep), keep &lt;any&gt;]]
    == [keep &quot;a&quot;]

This can be helpful when you&#39;re trying to build a rule with COMPOSE and the contention over GROUP! and trying to nest inside of it becomes a bummer.

As an example, let&#39;s say you&#39;re trying to build a KEEP parse rule inside a parse rule *(which I am actually at this moment trying to do in the whitespace interpreter project)*:

    name: &quot;Binky&quot;
    uparse ... [... collect [
         keep (compose [keep (to word! name)])
    ] ...]

Okay so that gives you **[keep Binky]**.  Not what you wanted since it will give an error that Binky is not defined.  You can quote it...

    keep (compose [keep &#39;(to word! name)])

Now you&#39;ve got **[keep &#39;Binky]**.  But you&#39;re not trying to match Binky in the input, you&#39;re trying to synthesize it out of thin air.  Imagine we need it in a GROUP!... let&#39;s just go ahead and use the wacky engroup operator to do that:

    keep (compose [keep (engroup quote to word! name)])

So we got our **[keep (&#39;Binky)]**... but that was annoying.  :cloud_with_rain:

Since @ can literally synthesize a value without matching in parse, we can make something less head-scratchy:

    keep (compose [keep @ (to word! name)])

And that gives us **[keep @ Binky]** which is much nicer.  The key to seeing why this breaks us out of the problem is that it lets us get at literal values without a GROUP!, which means we aren&#39;t trying to COMPOSE inside of COMPOSE groups.</description>

</aside>
<p>This week I've been turning over in my head how the <a href="https://forum.rebol.info/t/repurposing-the-xxx-xxx-for-undecorated-values/2135">change in meaning of @</a> under normal evaluation should affect its meaning in dialects.</p>
<p>We are free to choose new meanings entirely.  But when the dialect's needs intersect the meanings generally understood by the evaluator, it seems they should be <em>related</em>.</p>
<p>Hence these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If @ is to be some kind of "pick up a binding" thing, what binding is it talking about?  The binding of the parse rules going by?  Or the binding of the data being parsed (assuming it's a block?)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How would the important function of literal matching be accomplished if @ is taken away from that purpose?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>
<a name="binding-of-data-being-parsed-is-likely-more-useful-1" class="anchor" href="https://forum.rebol.info#binding-of-data-being-parsed-is-likely-more-useful-1"></a>Binding Of Data Being Parsed Is Likely More Useful</h2>
<p>If you're using PARSE to implement a dialect, you probably need to keep track of one or more binding contexts in effect as you recurse.</p>
<p>I've shown this being applied with the <a href="https://forum.rebol.info/t/how-to-capture-binding-of-parse-items/2137">single-arity operator tentatively called <strong><code>*in*</code></strong></a>.</p>
<p>This assumes there's something in the parse state which carries a relevant notion of a "current environment", which could be the context of the input.  But the person in charge of interpreting the dialect may have ideas about this that are different.</p>
<p>Should this instead be the behavior of @ ?</p>
<pre><code>parse [[word: 10]] [
   subparse @block! [
       let word: @set-word! let val: integer! (
           set word val
       )
   ]
]
</code></pre>
<p>It's different, because it isn't literally quoting its argument in the context of the parse rules.  If you wanted that, then you could theoretically accomplish it by putting it in a group, like <strong><code>(@block!)</code></strong> (this assumes the combinator for GROUP! uses the parse rules current environment).</p>
<p>It's a bit mind bendy... and suggests that if you used <strong>@(...)</strong> then it would use DO to run the GROUP! and then bind the result of that.</p>
<h2>
<a name="so-what-would-you-use-for-literal-matching-2" class="anchor" href="https://forum.rebol.info#so-what-would-you-use-for-literal-matching-2"></a>So What Would You Use For Literal Matching?</h2>
<p>Hrrrrm.</p>
<p>The writing on the wall may be that this is what GET-GROUP! / GET-WORD! / GET-TUPLE! do.</p>
<p>Those have been used for substituting rules, but maybe a keyword like REPARSE (like REEVAL?) should be doing that.</p>
<pre><code> parse "aaa" [some :(either true ["a"] ["b"])]

 parse "aaa" [some reparse (either true ["a"] ["b"])]
</code></pre>
<p>In the past I've suggest generalizing this operator and calling it INLINE.</p>
<pre><code> &gt;&gt; inline (second [a: b:]) 10
 == 10

 &gt;&gt; b
 == 10
</code></pre>
<p>So <strong>parse "aaa" [some inline (either true ["a"] ["b"])]</strong> would work.</p>
<p>To go the other direction and try to make "match this value literally" require an operator, it would be a weird quoting operator.  I think it's more coherent if the "no I mean literally" operator is GET-XXX!, because that lines up with "don't run this function" of GET-WORD! in the main evaluator.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>There's a lightly unsettling disconnect in this--which I've kind of learned to live with--but I'll mention it.</p>
<p>Defined this way, the @ operator itself has a parity.  In the normal evaluator:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; var: @ x
== x

&gt;&gt; var
== x
</code></pre>
<p>And in UPARSE:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; uparse "" [var: @ x]
== x

&gt;&gt; var
== x
</code></pre>
<p>All's good so far... this is the Gordian-knot slicer I talked about.  Synthesizing values out of thin air without a GROUP!, so it plays nicely with COMPOSE.</p>
<p>But the parity only exists for the standalone @.  It breaks down after that.  In the normal evaluator:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; var: @('x)
== @('x)

&gt;&gt; uparse [x] [var: @('x)]
== x
</code></pre>
<p>While we accept that UPARSE and regular code act differently, I'm a bit uncomfortable that @ would act the same but @(...) wouldn't.  Just something to wonder about.</p>
