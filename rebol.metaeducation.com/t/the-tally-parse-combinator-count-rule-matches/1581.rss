    <title>The TALLY Parse Combinator: Count Rule Matches</title>
    <link>https://rebol.metaeducation.com/t/the-tally-parse-combinator-count-rule-matches/1581</link>
    <description>There are cases where you want to know how many of a certain match there are.

Here&#39;s an example:

     uparse &quot;&lt;&lt;&lt;stuff&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot; [
         (n: 0)
         some [&quot;&lt;&quot; (n: n + 1)]
         x: between here n &quot;&gt;&quot;
     ]

Here I&#39;m just trying to match the number of `&gt;` on the right to how many `&lt;` were on the left.

*(Note: I still think this INTEGER! abstracting of rules is confusing to read.  Is a REPEAT/LOOP keyword missing that would help?  [I&#39;ve written about this, please register an opinion.](https://rebol.metaeducation.com/t/is-integer-in-parse-too-obfuscating/1578))*

## Meet TALLY!

     uparse &quot;&lt;&lt;&lt;stuff&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot; [
         n: tally &quot;&lt;&quot;
         x: between &lt;here&gt; repeat n &quot;&gt;&quot;

</aside>
<p>So I've never used this unusual suggestion of taking advantage of the zero-times-match.</p>
<p>But I'm wondering: <em>are we limiting TALLY's applications by not allowing it to ever fail?</em></p>
<p>If you want a non-matching TALLY to be zero, that's now easy enough, since integers are literal:</p>
<pre><code>[tally rule | 0]
</code></pre>
<p>And if you want NULL in the zero case, you could then say:</p>
<pre><code>opt tally rule
</code></pre>
<p>But you don't have these choices when TALLY will never fail.</p>
<p>Still...it's a little hard for me to say it won't consider a count of 0.  I can think of a lot of scenarios where that is what you want, and having to write [tally rule | 0] for it feels awkward.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>So oddly enough, TALLY without paying attention to the result can be used as the replacement for historical instances of ANY or WHILE.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; uparse "aaaccc" [some "a" tally "b" tally "c"]
== 3

&gt;&gt; uparse "aaaccc" [some "a" tally "b" some "c" tally "d"]
== 0
</code></pre>
<p><em>"Count the number of times this matches"</em> along with ignoring the count is pretty lightweight, and perhaps some would consider it idiomatic for <strong>opt some</strong></p>
<pre><code>opt some
tally    ; three fewer characters, same as WHILE
</code></pre>
<p>I don't care for the tradeoff myself...but...it's worth pointing out that many result-bearing constructs have their results ignored.</p>
