    <description>We already have source &lt;tag&gt; and do/import &lt;tag&gt; which looks up values on github repo.

I&#39;m suggesting that we can also provide functionality such as

     help &lt;compile&gt;

And instead of just saying it&#39;s a tag, it returns a list of urls to documents on here or trello that give instructions on how to compile the interpreter.

Or, `help &lt;void&gt;` would take us to the threads on handling voids.</description>

<p>I also think that <code>help [...]</code> vs <code>help ([...])</code> would be a good distinction, because taking a block as a dialect is more useful than telling you a literal block contains N elements or somesuch.</p>

</aside>
<p>So I'm going to go ahead and say that things like <strong><code>help 10</code></strong> coming back and telling you "10 is an integer" is so useless that it needs to be an error until we come up with a better meaning for it.</p>
<p>You can always say <strong><code>help (5 + 5)</code></strong> or similar to put an expression in a group that gets evaluated.</p>
<p>I've split up HELP into "dialected help" and "non-dialected help" (HELP-VALUE), which makes things clearer.  There's a switch statement in HELP for all the dialected types that makes this clearer, and HELP HELP will walk you through what the dialected types do.</p>
<p>It points you to using GROUP!s if you don't want dialected help:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; help help
USAGE:
    "HELP" @topic /web

DESCRIPTION:
    HELP is a dialected function.  If you want non-dialected help on any
    particular value, then pass that value in a GROUP! to get some very
    literal information back:

        help ('insert)   ; will tell you that INSERT is a WORD!
        help (10 + 20)   ; will tell you 30 is an INTEGER!

        help-value 10 + 20  ; alternative way to get this information

    Other usages have meaning dependent on the datatype.

    [WORD! TUPLE! PATH!] - Give help on what the value looks up to:

        help insert  ; describe argument types and return value of INSERT

    [TEXT!] - Search help strings in system for the given text as substring:

        help "insert"  ; will find INSERT, INSERT-ITEMS, DO-INSERT, etc.

    [ISSUE!] - Browse online topics with the given tag:

        help #compiling

    [TYPE-WORD!] - List all data instances of the type:

        help integer!  ; shows all the integer variables in the system

    [BLOCK!, etc.] - TBD.  Can you think of a good meaning for other types?

            <p>I don't have an issue with issue!</p>
<p>I'm just looking to implement some type of help system similar to the one Rebolbot provides for the chat forum.</p>

            <p>But I'd also say that if we have things like <code>do &lt;foo&gt;</code>, then <code>help &lt;foo&gt;</code> telling you what the foo module does and where it's being loaded from might be a better fit.</p>
<p>ISSUE! is more commonly associated with tagging, so perhaps what you're talking about could be <code>help #compile</code></p>
<p><strong>I also think that <code>help [...]</code> vs <code>help ([...])</code> would be a good distinction, because taking a block as a dialect is more useful than telling you a literal block contains N elements or somesuch.</strong></p>
<p>I don't know exactly what a help dialect would look like, but maybe people have ideas.  (parse rule applied to the names of all known entities?  <code>help ["a" to end]</code> for all functions starting with a?</p>

            <p>HELP can soft quote its argument, allowing one a distinction between <code>HELP (&lt;foo&gt;)</code> and <code>HELP &lt;foo&gt;</code>, and HELP X where X is <code>&lt;foo&gt;</code></p>
<p>I see no particular problem with HELP on literals giving more useful answers than if in a GROUP! or fetched from a variable.  If you say HELP ('APPEND) and it says APPEND is a WORD! with binding into the system and has 6 letters, nothing terrible about that.</p>
