    <title>Up Arrow For LIFT, Down Arrow For UNLIFT</title>
    <link>https://rebol.metaeducation.com/t/up-arrow-for-lift-down-arrow-for-unlift/2471</link>
    <description>Something I&#39;ve lamented is that we don&#39;t have an UNLIFT glyph on the keyboard.  I want down arrow.

    foo: func [...] [... return unlift value]
    bar: func [...] [... return ↓ value]

Given that we do support UTF-8, maybe going ahead and investing in a key binding for up arrow as synonym for LIFT and the down arrow as a synonym for UNLIFT is worth it...

---

&gt; **UPDATE 2025:** The behavior of **(^foo: ...)** to write lifted values, and **(^foo)** to fetch unlifted values, has allowed caret to serve both roles--working within the &quot;meta-represented&quot; realm.  This means the lone UNLIFT and LIFT operations are used much more rarely.
&gt;
&gt; But... this doesn&#39;t mean that in things like Rebmu, defining the up and down arrows for LIFT and UNLIFT respectively would be a bad idea...</description>
