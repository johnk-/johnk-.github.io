    <title>DEFAULT as Dialect?</title>
    <link>https://rebol.metaeducation.com/t/default-as-dialect/2198</link>
    <description>Flipping through the entirety of Carl&#39;s old Rebol blog, I came across a surprising post in which he considers [a trick for implementing DEFAULT using left-quoting in Rebol2](https://www.rebol.com/article/0388.html).

While it&#39;s very odd that there were ways to hack that in, I found myself more curious about the alternative proposal... to have DEFAULT work as a dialect.

     x: y: default [10 + 20]  ; can&#39;t set X
     default [x: y: 10 + 20]  ; dialect can offer handling of leading SET-WORD!s

This isn&#39;t a situation like comparing **let x: 10** and **let [x: 10]**.  LET doesn&#39;t need the block, so you get something inherently messier.  But because the nature of DEFAULT requires the block to suppress evaluation in the case that it doesn&#39;t need to do the defaulting, you have it either way. :thinking:

      &gt;&gt; x: null
      &gt;&gt; y: &lt;something&gt;

      &gt;&gt; default [x: y: 10 + 20]
      == ???  ; by convention, what&#39;s the answer?

      &gt;&gt; x
      == 30

      &gt;&gt; y
      == &lt;something&gt;

It&#39;s a bit of a problem on what the return result would be, and it&#39;s a bit misleading because you see on the screen [x: y: 10 + 20] but you get back something where after that `x &lt;&gt; y`.

I think I&#39;m going to have to go with thinking that the current way is better.  But again, I was a bit surprised to see the Rebol2 backwards-quoting-hack.</description>
