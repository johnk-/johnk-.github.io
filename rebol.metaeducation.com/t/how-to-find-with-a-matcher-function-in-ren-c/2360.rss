    <title>How To FIND With A Matcher Function in Ren-C?</title>
    <link>https://rebol.metaeducation.com/t/how-to-find-with-a-matcher-function-in-ren-c/2360</link>
    <description>[quote=&quot;hostilefork, post:2, topic:2327&quot;]
So I wondered... what if PARSE used the trailing slash notation, assuming that meant run a function as a typechecker?

```
&gt;&gt; parse [2 4 6] [some even?/]
== 6
```
[/quote]

I like it, if you can use any function it really shorten things.
But.. how do you search for it? `find block word?/`  ?</description>

            <p>We should start early: could you point to articles about ANTIFORM? to understand what it is?</p>

</aside>
<p>Yes, FIND works with antiform frames.  As does REPLACE, as it is based on FIND.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; replace [a 10 b 20] word?/ spread [word found]
== [word found 10 word found 20]
</code></pre>
<p>Antiforms have many advantages in terms of cleaning up edge cases, e.g. SPREAD above produces an antiform, curing us of issues pertaining to "/ONLY"</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; replace [[a b] a b a b] [a b] [c d e]
== [[c d e] a b a b] 

&gt;&gt; replace [[a b] a b a b] spread [a b] [c d e]
== [[a b] [c d e] [c d e]]

&gt;&gt; replace [[a b] a b a b] [a b] spread [c d e]
== [c d e a b a b]

&gt;&gt; replace [[a b] a b a b] spread [a b] spread [c d e]
== [[a b] c d e c d e]
</code></pre>
<p>NULL is also an antiform, which resolves issues like your question about "what happens when you put a NONE in a block, how do you know if there's a thing there or not as PICK is ambiguous".  You can't put null antiforms (or any antiforms) in blocks, so, it's unambiguous.</p>
<p>But here we see another advantage.  Antiform frames--which represent the kind of thing that triggers as a function call from word references--can't be in blocks.  So if they are passed to something like FIND or REPLACE (or suggested by a trailing slash notation in PARSE) then we know you aren't trying to match an "action in a block", because you can never put actions in blocks... only in their non-antiform states.</p>
<p>Ask if you have questions:</p>

    Here is a train of thought to help people realize why isotopes are needed, and why unifying their behaviors and mechanisms under a common umbrella makes sense.  It starts from the issue of solving /ONLY and then explains the generalization. 
As time permits, I'll come back and try to improve this... 

Historically, Rebol had a problem of how to append blocks "as-is" vs splicing.  This was resolved somewhat unsatisfyingly by splicing blocks by default, and using an /ONLY refinement to append as-iâ€¦
