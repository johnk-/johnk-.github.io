    <title>Revisiting The Riddle of the .r</title>
    <link>https://rebol.metaeducation.com/t/revisiting-the-riddle-of-the-r/1664</link>
    <description>When Rebol was thinking about coming out of the shadows and participating in the greater programming community, it seemed like trying to own the **`.r`** file extension was a bit misguided.

After all: a well established and much more popular statistical language was using it.  It was also out first--it came out in 1993, 4 years before Rebol&#39;s 1997.

...aaand the name of the language *actually was &quot;R&quot;*.  Which isn&#39;t a name to get very excited about, so it&#39;s not like there was going to be some argument like *&quot;no, WE want to call our language R!&quot;*

It seemed syntax highlighters on programming sites were not going to be allocating **.r** to Rebol.

Hence it seemed no problem to just go with changing to **`.reb`** - an improvement, even.  Communicated more.

## ...But In The Timeless World...

Since that time, things have changed:

* I&#39;ve become more partial to the lack of &quot;noise&quot; when listing files in a directory when they end in **.r** ... it makes the important part of the filename pop more.

* I had to help someone with their school project a couple years ago written in R.  I was not impressed with it.  While it has had growth lately, I think that growth just has more to do with the importance of data science... and does not reflect on the language itself (syntax/paradigm) having any particular merit.  It&#39;s just been around a long time and people are looking at data more.

* Collisions in file extensions have led syntax highlighters to use more heuristics, driven by the file content as well as the overall content of a source repository.  It looks like this will only become more the way things work in the future.

* Ren-C is renaming, to another name, which starts with R...  :rabbit: :raccoon: :recycle: :rocket: :robot: 

* The strength of Ren-C&#39;s hand has been growing, and I think if it keeps going it might have strength to impose some aspect of its will.  Sharing the .r file extension may be something people are ready to just accept.  *(With a much weaker hand, Red managed to push along a claim on the choice of &quot;red&quot;...though it does seem to screw them a bit on searchability.)*

## So What Do People Think?

Is rolling back to the historical **`.r`** a good way to detach a little more from the &quot;Rebol&quot; brand name, while still fitting into the ecology?

It&#39;s a thought.  No rush, just wanted to put the question out there.</description>

            <p>Since the header isn't used yet to reflect the dialect of rebol being used, I'd prefer we get all the letters after the r eg. .reb .red .ren .rev etc</p>
<p>Note, that REBOL was also originally all caps as well</p>

<p>Even better, thanks!</p>
<p>It's not like Rebol's claim on <strong>.r</strong> is all that shaky, there's a pretty big and established script library, that was being built up while neither Rebol nor R were very well known:</p>
