    <title>No-Interstitial-Delimiter Sequence Proposal (&quot;FUSED!&quot;)</title>
    <link>https://rebol.metaeducation.com/t/no-interstitial-delimiter-sequence-proposal-fused/1503</link>
    <description>@BlackATTR feels that being able to write code as **`operation(arg)`** with no space is critical to the SQL dialect.  While we haven&#39;t expressly prohibited that yet, it is lossy:

    &gt;&gt; [operation(arg)]
    == [operation (arg)]

I just noticed another case of tight syntax with a [%rebol-dom.r](http://www.rebol.org/view-script.r?script=rebol-dom.r) script where @Danny is trying to write expressions like:

    app[.width] = &quot;curly quew&quot;

Also still legal at the moment, but also still broken apart...and being two separate elements means it couldn&#39;t be quoted as a unit on the left (e.g. by an assignment-oriented equal):

    &gt;&gt; app[.width] = &quot;curly quew&quot;
    == [app [.width] = &quot;curly quew&quot;]

One of the reasons we&#39;d discussed making these kinds of constructs illegal would be to free them for new  meanings.

**Given that people want more density, might we think of this as a new datatype... like a PATH! or a TUPLE!, that simply has no delimiter?**

## Let&#39;s Imagine we call it FUSED!

*(Once this was proposed as PACK!, but now packs are something different... it was named out of the way as SCRUNCH! just to avoid confusion.  But now I think it&#39;s best called FUSED!)*

    &gt;&gt; p: operation(arg)  ; &#39;operation(arg) if eval active, but likely should not be
    == operation(arg)

    &gt;&gt; type of p
    == &amp;[fused]

    &gt;&gt; first p
    == operation  ; a WORD!

    &gt;&gt; second p
    == (arg)  ; a GROUP! with one element

## Plan -4 Issues

There&#39;s a bit of a problem in that we&#39;ve been saying you could write (a)(b) and [a][b] and have it mean the same thing as (a) (b) and [a] [b].  I use this frequently, because I do not like the spacing gap you get when braces follow each other.

    f: func [
        some-arg [integer!]
    ] [
        the gap there bothers me
    ]

    f: func [
        some-arg [integer!]
    ][
        without the gap looks better
    ]

That would suggest the rules for fusing would disallow adjacent GROUP!s and BLOCK!s, which would rule out interesting fuseds that might represent multidimensional array access:

    &gt;&gt; [foo[x][y]]
    == [foo[x] [y]]  ; would have to be a fused and a block?

Ladislav was always rather adamant that spaces should be everywhere because spaces had significance.  So he wasn&#39;t in favor of the aesthetic gap-closing.  If FUSED! turned out to be truly useful, then it might vindicate his belief.  I dunno.

## How Would It Reconcile Priority With TUPLE! and PATH!  ?

The interstitial delimiters prioritize by &quot;heft&quot; (**`/`** is on top of **`:`** is on top of **`.`**) And you can&#39;t get much less hefty than nothing.  So fuseds would be on the bottom of the totem pole.

    a.b/c.d[e f] =&gt; to path! compose/deep [a.b c.(to fused! [d [e f]])]
    a.b[c d]e/f =&gt; to path! compose/deep [a.(to fused! [b [c d] e]) f]

Not that these examples are very useful, but I believe that&#39;s what they should be.

## There&#39;d Be Some Issues With Numbers

If numbers are allowed, you are going to run into trouble with things like how `1e...` leads into exponential notation, and the fact that you get problematic reversals with **1a** and **a1**.  The first seems like a candidate for being a FUSED!, while the second is what we&#39;d see as a normal WORD!

## No Fusing With BLANK!-Terminated Paths or Tuples 

You couldn&#39;t merge **a/** and **[b]** to get a FUSED!, because **a/[b]** is a PATH!.  *(This is a natural consequence/feature and not a flaw.)*

Also, while # is a legal &quot;empty issue&quot;, it&#39;s also a modifier.  So the #[a] probably shouldn&#39;t be a FUSED!.  Unless there&#39;s some way that would fit into a broader master plan, by virtue of what that fused would mean... e.g. if **# = first fused** would mean something was typically a datatype... :thinking: 
 
Anyway, a lot to think about.  But if people are dug in and insistent that they have to have these notations, then we should give consideration to the idea.</description>

<p>I certainly don't think it should become an operative Rebol language construct.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Those are pretty good examples of why FUSED! should almost always be evaluator-inert.</p>
<p>So I guess we can assume things like <strong><code>array[n]</code></strong> would do nothing, and only mean "pick out of array" in some dialected application.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://rebol.metaeducation.com/t/backtick-literals-and-an-axis-of-extensibility/2235">backtick literals</a>, <strong>1x1</strong> would be FUSED!, and <strong>`1x1`</strong> could be a PAIR!.  But in dialected contexts you could transform between them.</p>
<p>Although hmm... if you want a function to be called <strong><code>convert-to-utf8</code></strong> and that was a FUSED! naming it, it would have to be evaluator active.  <img src="https://rebol.metaeducation.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=14" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20">  So I guess the usual exemption for languages, where if the run is all words and integers, and starts with a word, it's active...otherwise <strong>1x1</strong> and <strong><code>1em</code></strong> would be evaluator active.</p>

<p>I still had a little bit of crack laying around from the other night, and after smoking a little of it, I started wondering...</p>
<p><strong>What if WORD!s did not allow numbers?</strong></p>
<p>And instead, we allowed you to make CHAINs with FUSEDs.</p>
<pre><code>4chan: https://www.4chan.org
</code></pre>
<p>A fused with just WORD!s and INTEGER!s in it could be deemed legal for binding.  Bearing in mind also that if you have variations of a function, you could do that with <strong><code>some-function:1</code></strong> and <strong><code>some-function:2</code></strong> dispatching to the same function but offering it the chain for processing.</p>

<p>I do not see any particular reason why <strong>thing(...)</strong> would be more or less legitimate to want than <strong>thing[...]</strong></p>
<p>And I think that if people had syntax open to <strong>thing(...)(...)</strong> and <strong>thing[...][...]</strong> they would find uses for those too.</p>
<p>Note the API would be the same thing as PATH! and TUPLE!: where since you have constraints on what you can form this way, and they "change types" when things are removed, they are immutable while in the fused form.</p>
<p>So things like this need to be illegal:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; p: a(b)

&gt;&gt; take p
== (b)  ; looks like a GROUP!

&gt;&gt; take p
==  ; back to those same flaky vanishing issues

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; [num units]: parse size [pack [integer! ['px | 'em]]]
== 10

&gt;&gt; num
== 10

&gt;&gt; units
== px
</code></pre>
<p>But the point is that if we can lean on a general mechanic--especially one that's mostly already written--this might be a breakthrough worth a bit of shakeup... like having to put spaces between your blocks ordinarily.</p>

            <p>My CSS brain does appreciate the possibilities here—it could be a way to express small dialected values:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-plaintext">red: rgb(255 0 0)
move: translate(-1x1)
</code></pre>
<p>Or indeed SQL, or Javascript, or other things.</p>
<p>My Rebol brain says, this is un-Rebol-like! I certainly don't think it should become an operative Rebol language construct.</p>
<p>I'd be more inclined to recognizing <code>thing( ... )</code> as a distinct container type recognizing the pattern across other data formats/languages. It could be inert in and of itself thus really only useful in dialects. Forgoing Plan -4 by packing certain combinations of types may tie hands with new forms in the future.</p>

            <p>I appreciate the consideration here. I also have no idea if a FUSED! might be useful outside of a specific kind of dialect. Which I suppose isn't a very strong vote in favor.</p>
<p>It would be a slight boost to supporting an SQL syntax (or spreadsheet macro). My main challenge is not parsing the pattern (be it FUSED! or just word! + group!), but recursively unraveling the nested construct to  translate into ren-c text! manipulating expressions.</p>
<p>I have a low-key need to be able to express FUSED!-like structures as though they're blocks:</p>
<pre><code>foo(bar(baz)))
foo(bar, baz("bip"))
foo(bar, baz("bim", "bap"))
</code></pre>

            <p><a class="mention" href="https://rebol.metaeducation.com/u/blackattr">@BlackATTR</a> feels that being able to write code as <strong><code>operation(arg)</code></strong> with no space is critical to the SQL dialect.  While we haven't expressly prohibited that yet, it is lossy:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; [operation(arg)]
== [operation (arg)]
</code></pre>
<p>I just noticed another case of tight syntax with a <a href="http://www.rebol.org/view-script.r?script=rebol-dom.r">%rebol-dom.r</a> script where <a class="mention" href="https://rebol.metaeducation.com/u/danny">@Danny</a> is trying to write expressions like:</p>
<pre><code>app[.width] = "curly quew"
</code></pre>
<p>Also still legal at the moment, but also still broken apart...and being two separate elements means it couldn't be quoted as a unit on the left (e.g. by an assignment-oriented equal):</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; app[.width] = "curly quew"
== [app [.width] = "curly quew"]
</code></pre>
<p>One of the reasons we'd discussed making these kinds of constructs illegal would be to free them for new  meanings.</p>
<p><strong>Given that people want more density, might we think of this as a new datatype... like a PATH! or a TUPLE!, that simply has no delimiter?</strong></p>

<p><em>(Once this was proposed as PACK!, but now packs are something different... it was named out of the way as SCRUNCH! just to avoid confusion.  But now I think it's best called FUSED!)</em></p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; p: operation(arg)  ; 'operation(arg) if eval active, but likely should not be
== operation(arg)

&gt;&gt; type of p
== &amp;[fused]

&gt;&gt; first p
== operation  ; a WORD!

&gt;&gt; second p
== (arg)  ; a GROUP! with one element
</code></pre>
<h2><a name="p-4721-plan-4-issues-2" class="anchor" href="https://rebol.metaeducation.com#p-4721-plan-4-issues-2"></a>Plan -4 Issues</h2>
<p>There's a bit of a problem in that we've been saying you could write (a)(b) and [a][b] and have it mean the same thing as (a) (b) and [a] [b].  I use this frequently, because I do not like the spacing gap you get when braces follow each other.</p>
<pre><code>f: func [
    some-arg [integer!]
] [
    the gap there bothers me
]

f: func [
    some-arg [integer!]
][
    without the gap looks better
]
</code></pre>
<p>That would suggest the rules for fusing would disallow adjacent GROUP!s and BLOCK!s, which would rule out interesting fuseds that might represent multidimensional array access:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; [foo[x][y]]
== [foo[x] [y]]  ; would have to be a fused and a block?
</code></pre>
<p>Ladislav was always rather adamant that spaces should be everywhere because spaces had significance.  So he wasn't in favor of the aesthetic gap-closing.  If FUSED! turned out to be truly useful, then it might vindicate his belief.  I dunno.</p>
<h2><a name="p-4721-how-would-it-reconcile-priority-with-tuple-and-path-3" class="anchor" href="https://rebol.metaeducation.com#p-4721-how-would-it-reconcile-priority-with-tuple-and-path-3"></a>How Would It Reconcile Priority With TUPLE! and PATH!  ?</h2>
<p>The interstitial delimiters prioritize by "heft" (<strong><code>/</code></strong> is on top of <strong><code>:</code></strong> is on top of <strong><code>.</code></strong>) And you can't get much less hefty than nothing.  So fuseds would be on the bottom of the totem pole.</p>
<pre><code>a.b/c.d[e f] =&gt; to path! compose/deep [a.b c.(to fused! [d [e f]])]
a.b[c d]e/f =&gt; to path! compose/deep [a.(to fused! [b [c d] e]) f]
</code></pre>
<p>Not that these examples are very useful, but I believe that's what they should be.</p>
<h2><a name="p-4721-thered-be-some-issues-with-numbers-4" class="anchor" href="https://rebol.metaeducation.com#p-4721-thered-be-some-issues-with-numbers-4"></a>There'd Be Some Issues With Numbers</h2>
<p>If numbers are allowed, you are going to run into trouble with things like how <code>1e...</code> leads into exponential notation, and the fact that you get problematic reversals with <strong>1a</strong> and <strong>a1</strong>.  The first seems like a candidate for being a FUSED!, while the second is what we'd see as a normal WORD!</p>
<h2><a name="p-4721-no-fusing-with-blank-terminated-paths-or-tuples-5" class="anchor" href="https://rebol.metaeducation.com#p-4721-no-fusing-with-blank-terminated-paths-or-tuples-5"></a>No Fusing With BLANK!-Terminated Paths or Tuples</h2>
<p>You couldn't merge <strong>a/</strong> and <strong>[b]</strong> to get a FUSED!, because <strong>a/[b]</strong> is a PATH!.  <em>(This is a natural consequence/feature and not a flaw.)</em></p>
<p>Also, while # is a legal "empty issue", it's also a modifier.  So the #[a] probably shouldn't be a FUSED!.  Unless there's some way that would fit into a broader master plan, by virtue of what that fused would mean... e.g. if <strong># = first fused</strong> would mean something was typically a datatype... <img src="https://rebol.metaeducation.com/images/emoji/twitter/thinking.png?v=14" title=":thinking:" class="emoji" alt=":thinking:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
<p>Anyway, a lot to think about.  But if people are dug in and insistent that they have to have these notations, then we should give consideration to the idea.</p>
