    <title>What to call an Arity-1 wget or curl-like function?</title>

At first I just did a **wget** of the scripts:
[/quote]

I&#39;ve felt for a while we need something parallel to wget where you just specify a URL! of what you want and it writes it.

Calling it **wget** or **curl** would come with expectations that it would have all the options of those programs *(I think we could/should make variadic WGET and CURL functions that emulate a useful subset of those options!)*

Is there a good name for a simpler arity-1 function that just does the above?

    xxx: func [filename [file! url!]] [
        write (second split-path filename) (read filename)

            <p>This is a tricky one. I think the act of writing/saving something to your local machine is a significant decision, so whatever the function name is, I wouldn't want to obscure the fact that it's ultimately a WRITE operation.</p>
<p>FETCH is a decent word. It's commonly used in SQL to paginate results, i.e., you provide it an offset to display result rows X thru Y.</p>

            <p>In the Repl, DOWNLOAD is currently taken for transferring files to your host system's hard drive... not to the in-browser filesystem.  We need something for that.</p>
<p>webget is better than wget...but more generally I'm thinking of this as an arity-1 COPY.  So it might not be from the web (a non-web URL!, or just a FILE!).</p>
<p>It's really just an arity-1 function that assumes the target location for a write.</p>
<p>Maybe FETCH ?</p>
