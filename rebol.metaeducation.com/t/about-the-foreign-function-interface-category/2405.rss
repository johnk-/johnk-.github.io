    <description>FFI is a means of calling C functions from other languages.

Support for FFI originated with Rebol2&#39;s paid version, &quot;Rebol/Command&quot;:

**[https://www.rebol.com/docs/library.html](https://www.rebol.com/docs/library.html)**

It wasn&#39;t part of the Rebol3 open-source release, but Shixin Zeng of Atronix Engineering implemented a version of it, described in this 2019 video:

That implementation was baked in to the core of Atronix/R3.

While FFI was not considered a high priority for Ren-C, removing it as being required from the build was a priority.  But rather than deleting it, it was migrated into an extension:

The extension was put on hold in 2021, but brought back to life in 2025.</description>
