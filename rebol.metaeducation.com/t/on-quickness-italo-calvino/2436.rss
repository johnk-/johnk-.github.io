    <title>On Quickness (Italo Calvino)</title>
    <link>https://rebol.metaeducation.com/t/on-quickness-italo-calvino/2436</link>
    <description>I cite this short passage by **[Italo Calvino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italo_Calvino)** fairly often:

&gt; *Among Chuang-tzu’s many skills, he was an expert draftsman.*
&gt;
&gt; *The Chinese emperor asked Chuang-tzu to draw a crab.*
&gt;
&gt; *Chuang-tzu replied that he would need five years plus a country estate and 12 servants.*
&gt;
&gt; *The emperor gave him what he requested.*
&gt;
&gt; *Five years later, Chuang-tzu still had not started on the drawing.*
&gt;
&gt; *&quot;I need another five years&quot;, Chuang-tzu said to the emperor.*
&gt;
&gt; *The emperor granted them.*
&gt;
&gt; *After 10 years, Chuang-tzu took up his brush and in a single stroke drew a crab, the most perfect crab ever seen.*

:crab: 

It may not seem like an exact analogy for Ren-C&#39;s development, in the sense that there&#39;s lots of incremental steps which are &quot;visible&quot;...to the very few people looking.  But I think to most, the true profound nature of its design will seem like it came out of nowhere, while it&#39;s the result of an epic amount of pondering.

I&#39;m of the belief that my resistance to push or publish something that&#39;s not fully formed has been an asset.  And I&#39;m of the belief that it&#39;s going to blow people&#39;s minds.</description>
