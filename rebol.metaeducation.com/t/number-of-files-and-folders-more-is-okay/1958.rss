    <title>Number of Files and Folders: More Is Okay</title>
    <link>https://rebol.metaeducation.com/t/number-of-files-and-folders-more-is-okay/1958</link>
    <description>In the quest for simplicity, R3-Alpha had an aesthetic that tried to be very minimalist in the source tree.

The top level had only this:

    make/
    src/
    .gitattributes
    .gitignore
    LICENSE
    NOTICE
    README

The **%make/** directory contained:

    makefile
    makefile.vc
    vcbuild.bat

The **%src/** directory contained:

    boot/       20 files
    core/       95 files
    include/    31 files
    mezz/       31 files
    os/          7 files, with 2 directories of about 10 files each
    tools/      10 files

The files themselves vary in size, but this just gives a perspective of about how many files there are.

## Ren-C and Red use *MANY* more files and directories, BUT...

***Largely I think this is okay, moreover can be beneficial to understanding the code.***

While we should be skeptical of large amounts of complexity, I don&#39;t think there should be a kneejerk reaction to a lot of *files*.

Filesystems were invented for a reason: organization.  If arranging things in separate files makes the organization clear, it is good.

Yet there should be some justification for why a directory exists.  For instance: I think every directory should have a README.md in it, which explains why those files are grouped together.</description>
