    <title>:FOO is now a &quot;Refinement&quot;... so what is /FOO called?</title>
    <link>https://rebol.metaeducation.com/t/foo-is-now-a-refinement-so-what-is-foo-called/2308</link>
    <description>There are pieces of code that use leading-slash-words as dialect parts, without having anything to do with them being &quot;refinements&quot;.

We might call them **`RUN-WORD`**, because that&#39;s what **`/FOO`** does in the evaluator... runs FOO if it&#39;s a function, and errors if not.

More visually they could be **`SLASH-WORD`** with the implied fact the &quot;slash&quot; comes before the word helping to distinguish it from **`FOO/`**.  But it seems that they both have equal claim on being slash words to me.

I&#39;m going to call them RUN-WORD just to keep moving along, but think about it.</description>
