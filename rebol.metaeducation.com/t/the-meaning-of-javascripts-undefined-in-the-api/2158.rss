    <title>The Meaning of JavaScript&#39;s &quot;Undefined&quot; in the API</title>
    <link>https://rebol.metaeducation.com/t/the-meaning-of-javascripts-undefined-in-the-api/2158</link>
    <description>Something that has been kind of on my mind is the relationship between JavaScript&#39;s `undefined` and Ren-C&#39;s TRASH state.

I&#39;ve set it up so that if you have a JS-NATIVE that doesn&#39;t have a return statement, that returns TRASH.  That&#39;s consistent with plain functions that don&#39;t have a return statement.

But should **reb.Value(&quot;print {Hello}&quot;);** return `undefined` (the way that **reb.Value(&quot;select [a 10 b 20] &#39;c&quot;);** returns `null`?)

It seems there&#39;s no value in JavaScript that can cause an error on conditional testing, so I guess maybe mapping it to `undefined` is about the best we can do.</description>
