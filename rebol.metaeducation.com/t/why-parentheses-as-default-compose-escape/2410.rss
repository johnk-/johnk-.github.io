    <title>Why Parentheses As Default COMPOSE Escape?</title>
    <link>https://rebol.metaeducation.com/t/why-parentheses-as-default-compose-escape/2410</link>
    <description>Conventional wisdom for interpolation or templating would be to use something fairly uncommon, so as not to be likely to be confused with the content.
 
Yet Ren-C (and Red) use parentheses as a default:

    red&gt;&gt; as url! #rejoin &quot;http://(site)/(resource)?param=(date as &quot;yyyy&quot;)&quot;
    == http://example.com/whatever.html?param=1998

    ren-c&gt;&gt; compose http://(site)/(resource)?param=(date as &quot;yyyy&quot;)
    == http://example.com/whatever.html?param=1998

Why isn&#39;t something more uncommon used as the default, like `{{}}`</description>

            <p>You can see Red having some of this debate in <strong><a href="https://github.com/red/REP/issues/112">REP 112</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Ren-C's concept is to make it easy to customize, which is why there is COMPOSE2... the arity-2 compose, which takes a pattern:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; num: 1000

&gt;&gt; compose2 '{{}} "(Hello) {{num + 20}} {World}"
== "(Hello) 1020 {World}"
</code></pre>
<p>Since you're able to customize it easily, I think that the most potential is had by capitalizing on a short default... which would lead to picking <strong><code>[]</code></strong> or <strong><code>{}</code></strong> or <strong><code>()</code></strong>.</p>
<p>Of these three, I think <strong><code>()</code></strong> is the most compelling:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It is consistent with historical COMPOSE of lists, where groups were the composed tihng.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Strings are frequently bracketed, e.g. <strong><code>--[...]--</code></strong>, so the parentheses stand out better.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Parentheses are the most "malleable" in the sense of "likely to vaporize", e.g.they are evaluated where blocks are not</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It's a bold choice to use plain old parentheses, but it feels like it's shaping up as being a clear winner as a default.</p>
