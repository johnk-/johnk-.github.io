    <description>ISO-8601 dates are very close to Rebol dates, but just different enough to make it a pain.

Are Rebol dates more readable?  Yes.  Are they so much better as to make it worthwhile to buck the standard?  :man_shrugging:  Are they in conflict with generalized PATH! representation?  :man_shrugging: 

## Nevermind, This Post Is About Something Else

Let&#39;s say I just want to capture the YEAR, the MONTH, and the DAY out of an ISO-8601 date.

    parse isodate [
        year: between &lt;here&gt; &quot;-&quot;
        month: between &lt;here&gt; &quot;-&quot;
        day: between &lt;here&gt; &quot;T&quot;
        ...
     ]

Despite having BETWEEN, it&#39;s laborious.  *(Historical Rebol needs `copy to &quot;-&quot;` followed by a SKIP, even more convoluted, and worse if you need to skip more than one series item).*

It needs a shorthand.  We have TAG! at our disposal, still:

    parse isodate [year: &lt;*&gt; &quot;-&quot; month: &lt;*&gt; &quot;-&quot; day: &lt;*&gt; &quot;T&quot; ...]

And it could be plain **`*`**:

    parse isodate [year: * &quot;-&quot; month: * &quot;-&quot; day: * &quot;T&quot; ...]

But I kind of find myself wishing for another lexical type that means &quot;capture&quot; that has the word &quot;in it&quot;.  I&#39;d thought about this as being the meaning of `@xxx` before the current interpretation, and also `$xxx`:

    parse isodate [$year &quot;-&quot; $month &quot;-&quot; $day &quot;T&quot; ...]

But almost certainly, $ is going to be binding-related in the default combinator set.

## It Feels Weak To Not Have An Answer For This

Other parsing systems will always seem like they have an edge if there isn&#39;t a shorthand for this &quot;capture until the next rule&quot;.

But it may be that the default combinators are just too saturated and general-purpose to sacrifice any WORD!-based syntax for such a capture.  It might have to be another parameterized parse variation.</description>

<p>I kind of find myself wishing for another lexical type that means "capture" that has the word "in it". I'd thought about this as being the meaning of <code>@xxx</code> before the current interpretation, and also <code>$xxx</code>:</p>
<pre data-code-wrap="plaintext"><code class="lang-plaintext">parse isodate [$year "-" $month "-" $day "T" ...]
</code></pre>
<p>But almost certainly, $ is going to be binding-related in the default combinator set.</p>

</aside>
<p>Given that there are more parts in the box, I thought of a possibility for this:</p>
<pre><code>parse isodate [:year: "-" :month: "-" :day: "T" ...]
</code></pre>
<p>It still has a colon on the end, which can help hint that it's an assignment.  But the colon on the front gives it a visual sense of balance, pulling it left to where you might imagine it doesn't take any arguments.  And it suggests perhaps connecting the left and right in a way that would capture between it.</p>
<p>It's generalized to where you can put tuples inside it:</p>
<pre><code>parse isodate [:date.year: "-" :date.month: "-" :date.day: "T" ...]
</code></pre>
<p>It's certainly <em>weird</em>, but it's the best idea I've had so far.  Beyond just "<code>$year</code> and <code>@year</code> are taken", I actually think it's superior.</p>
