    <description>This is for discussions about how to process UTF-8 text into Rebol elements.

Generally speaking, historical Rebol tended to break things up into separate parts more often:

    rebol2&gt;&gt; load &quot;(a b)/c&quot;
    == [(a b) /c]

Modern ideas have many more ways of merging parts into single elements:

    &gt;&gt; transcode &quot;(a b)/c&quot;
    == [(a b)/c]

There are a particularly large number of nuances about how TAG! is handled.  As the tip of the iceberg, **`&lt;&gt;`** is a WORD!, and not an empty tag.</description>
