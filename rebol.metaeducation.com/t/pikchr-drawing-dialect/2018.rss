    <title>Pikchr Drawing Dialect</title>
    <link>https://rebol.metaeducation.com/t/pikchr-drawing-dialect/2018</link>
    <description>This is an interesting dialect-looking thing that&#39;s a Unix utility someone showed me for diagrams.  It might interest @rgchris, or others.  It&#39;s called PIKCHR.

You can try it online at [https://pikchr.org/home/pikchrshow](https://pikchr.org/home/pikchrshow) ... there are a few examples.

It&#39;s a textual set of instructions that lets you lay things out... but differently from something like PDF, it captures intents in a pretty interesting way for aligments and duplication.

Look how it lays out this &quot;swim lanes&quot; example graphic:
