<p>There needs to be some thread here about "computing horror stories". A month ago there was an article on Hacker News about NixOS and it's packaging system.  As some Nix user had just contacted me about packaging xu4, I thought I'd give it a spin.  After downloading the ISO and installing it on a virtual machine I went to get a package listing...<br>
and was greeted with some vague error message.</p>
<p>It turns out that the package manager was using well over 1GB of RAM and simply crapped out because my VM didn't have enough.  Some NixOS user told me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Listing all packages is a bit of a weak spot. The entire package set is described in a lazy, functional language and listing or searching it requires evaluating the entire thing."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is an entire OS custom built around a package manager, and it couldn't even give me a listing of my packages.  The Nix developers want to geek out about their language, but I just want tools that work.</p>
<p>Thankfully, data-oriented design is now a thing, so I know at least someone is paying attention.</p>

              <p>I can't speak for anyone but myself here, but for the past 18+ months, there's been an enormous amount of experimental language design taking place in this project.</p>
<p>My $.02 is that the focus has been on solving some of the critical language design flaws of Redbol languages and letting those building-blocks settle/harden before devoting limited time/energy in the optimization space right now.</p>
<p>That's not to say that zero attention is allocated to optimization, but I think it's lower on the list of priorities until the fundamental design pieces can snap into place.</p>

<p>Rebol was an attempt at grappling with the problems of overly complex and bloated software. Part of that means not wasting RAM or CPU cycles.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Rebol was kind of a grab-bag of agendas, IMO, and I think people were able to <em>"see what they wanted to see"</em> in that.  This consensus became difficult when an artifact like Rebol2 was seen as a start... but a start, to what?  The ensuing fragmentation is not that suprising.</p>
<p>Tons of languages try to minimize CPU use or memory.  Where I saw Rebol as being different was dialecting...to let you pare back the <em>source</em> (or more generally, "right-size" it) by bending words to mean something appropriate to your task.</p>
<p>So looking at the kind of thing you'd probably not do, here's a TLS transition dialect in Ren-C:</p>
<p><a href="../prettier-tls-state-tables-and-assessing-the-cost/1736.html" class="inline-onebox">Prettier TLS State Tables (and Assessing the Cost)</a></p>
<p>Small things like that do make the TLS extension load more slowly (substantially so with the parsing being usermode).  Multiply that by a lot--because I'm willing to do similar experiments all over the codebase.</p>
<p>But at this stage of the game I feel such explorations are valuable.  They're educational, much like people being able to build something like DESTRUCTURE in minutes:</p>
<p><a href="../destructure-dialect/1877.html" class="inline-onebox">DESTRUCTURE Dialect</a></p>
<p>As I like to say, I don't throw softballs.  And because I'm liberal in my use and test of such things--including during the boot process--I don't find your comparison table surprising or worrying in and of itself (<a href="../start-quit-measurement/1972.html">though it needs to be done right if it's to be done</a>).  I'm just not seeking to optimize that statistic for a default test distribution at this time.  And I even keep around things I never would have written myself (like the Atronix "locale" extension) because it now and again exercises a case that gives me food for thought.</p>
<p>There's nothing particularly endemic to Ren-C's design prohibiting it from having a build configuration within striking distance of Boron's or R3-Alpha's <em>if it wanted to</em>.  There's simply no reason to pursue that.  Certainly not to try and get you (or Kaj, or Oldes) to use it...I like to focus on puzzles that <em>might</em> have a solution.  <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png%3Fv=14" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
<p>I'm more about letting people express themselves elegantly in small character counts--and have that expression pull of miracles.  In terms of the artifact that does it, I do accounting in the large in terms of dependencies.</p>
<p>But maybe when the time comes, pressures would be such that things like stylizing the TLS transitions is wasteful in the scheme of things.  I don't know.  It still feels pretty far away to be concerned, especially since the web build doesn't use the TLS extension at all.</p>
