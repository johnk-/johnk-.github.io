    <title>Replaying Console Commands (Red&#39;s &quot;Spaces Console&quot;)</title>
    <link>https://rebol.metaeducation.com/t/replaying-console-commands-reds-spaces-console/2107</link>
    <description>Red&#39;s hiiamboris has made an alternative console (built on his [&quot;Spaces&quot; VID alternative](https://rebol.metaeducation.com/t/vid-s-or-spaces-from-reds-hiiamboris/1886)).  It appears you can go back to an earlier expression and edit it, and if you do, it will ripple the changes through running all your future expressions again.

It&#39;s called **[&quot;Spaces Console&quot;](https://codeberg.org/hiiamboris/red-spaces/src/branch/master/programs/console)**, and it&#39;s an interesting idea.  Sort of fuses together a watchlist with a console.

Note that Ren-C&#39;s Web Console can keep Ctrl-Z&#39;ing to undo console output and go back to edit previous expressions... but you lose the subsequent commands.  Though the web console also has a [watchlist like the one in the Qt Ren Garden](https://youtu.be/0exDvv5WEv4?t=326).

Anyway, something to think about.

Note that the current implementation appears to be slow ([Gitter link](https://matrix.to/#/!EorVRCzrVpjojJtctJ:gitter.im/$nf_3fEnM_24P0qAMnxdnwdcOKF3NVsAtzR6YnZq0PKM?via=gitter.im&amp;via=matrix.org&amp;via=chat.weho.st)):

&gt; **Gregg:** *&quot;I thought it didn&#39;t like `repeat i 100 [print i]`, but just took a long time to process it. ~10s.&quot;*
&gt;
&gt; **Boris:** *&quot;printing is O(n^2) atm, need to overcome laziness and make it lower level :D&quot;*</description>

            <p>Not to diminish how nice this is, it isn’t actually a new idea; it’s merely a clever form of notebook interface. Other (and more well-developed) implementations for other languages include <a href="https://plutojl.org/">Pluto.jl</a> and <a href="https://observablehq.com/">Observable</a>.</p>
