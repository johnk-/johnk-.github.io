    <title>REIFY and DEGRADE: a Narrower LIFT and UNLIFT</title>
    <link>https://rebol.metaeducation.com/t/reify-and-degrade-a-narrower-lift-and-unlift/2163</link>
    <description>In the &quot;small improvements can be big&quot; category, I think that I&#39;ve settled on the name for the function that turns quasiforms into antiforms, but leaves everything else alone: **DEGRADE**...and its complement **REIFY** which turns antiforms into quasiforms (but leaves everything else alone).

    &gt;&gt; first [1020 ~null~]
    == 1020

    &gt;&gt; second [1020 ~null~]
    == ~null~

    &gt;&gt; degrade first [1020 ~null~]
    == 1020

    &gt;&gt; degrade second [1020 ~null~]
    == \~null~\  ; antiform

    &gt;&gt; 304
    == 304

    &gt;&gt; reify 304
    == 304

    &gt;&gt; okay
    == \~okay~\  ; antiform
    
    &gt;&gt; reify okay
    == ~okay~

If you&#39;re dealing with a full-band situation where you genuinely don&#39;t know if you&#39;re working with a &quot;meaningful quasiform&quot; where *quasi means quasi*, you have to use LIFT and UNLIFT.  But if you know that quasiforms aren&#39;t part of your data of interest, REIFY and DEGRADE can help you dodge adding and removing quote marks much (or most) of the time.

Maybe it would be better (and give Chris less of a heart attack) if it said:

```
for-each [sigil&#39; items] [
    ~null~ [  word   tu.p.le   pa/th   [bl o ck]   (gr o up)  ]
    &#39;^     [ ^word  ^tu.p.le  ^pa/th  ^[bl o ck]  ^(gr o up)  ]
    &#39;@     [ @word  @tu.p.le  @pa/th  @[bl o ck]  @(gr o up)  ]
    &#39;$     [ $word  $tu.p.le  $pa/th  $[bl o ck]  $(gr o up)  ]
 ][
      for-each item items [
          if (unlift sigil&#39;) &lt;&gt; sigil of item [
              panic [mold item]
          ]
      ]
 ]
```
[/quote]

I like how DEGRADE can be used in situations like this to help you strike the quotes on the normal values...since SIGIL OF never returns quasiforms, only a sigil or a null antiform:

    for-each [sigil items] [
        ~null~ [  word   tu.p.le   pa/th   [bl o ck]   (gr o up)  ]
        ^      [ ^word  ^tu.p.le  ^pa/th  ^[bl o ck]  ^(gr o up)  ]
        @      [ @word  @tu.p.le  @pa/th  @[bl o ck]  @(gr o up)  ]
        $      [ $word  $tu.p.le  $pa/th  $[bl o ck]  $(gr o up)  ]
    ][
        for-each item items [
            if (degrade sigil) &lt;&gt; sigil of item [
                panic [mold item]
            ]
        ]
    ]

I think this will be a useful and common pattern.

</blockquote>
<p>When these names were initially picked, LIFT and UNLIFT were called "META and UNMETA".</p>
<p>Now that they have more fitting names, I can more easily see these being:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>REIFY =&gt; <strong><code>LIFT:ANTIFORMS</code></strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DEGRADE =&gt; <strong><code>UNLIFT:QUASIFORMS</code></strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It's more palatable with the lift term.  But it doesn't exactly speak to what happens if you're lifting a non-antiform or unlifting a non-quasiform.</p>
<p>I probably still like having distinct terms as REIFY and DEGRADE.  Would be good to have usability tests for that.</p>

<p>I guess I should have an answer to the question of why I didn't pair REIFY with UNREIFY.</p>
<p>Uh, maybe it should be called that?</p>
<p>The rationale in my head was something like:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>"oh, it's not always UNREIFY-ing, it leaves non-quasi things in their plain forms".  But it's not "always degrading" either.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>UNREIFY doesn't scan well as a word (but UNLIFT does?)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There's an implicit meaning here where it's "REIFY-ANTIFORMS" and "UNREIFY-QUASIFORMS".  Something about REIFY only applying to antiforms makes clear intuitive sense (you don't need to reify a WORD!, it's already reified).  But you could imagine UNREIFY-ing a WORD! and getting an antiform word.  So the "-QUASIFORMS" is not as obvious.</p>
<p>I'm not 100% confident that the benefit of choosing a word besides UNREIFY is worth breaking the pairing, but DEGRADE is less off-putting in the source.  So it's what I went with.</p>
