    <description>We should be in a position to [accept donations](https://www.patreon.com/rebolfoundation) both for running of this forum, rebol.info and for specific tasks.

I was wondering how that might happen transparently.  @BlackATTR suggested using [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/) so I wonder if that could be used to fund a Rebol Foundation which then dishes out funds for the ongoing maintenance of our intrastructure.  But I see that they take 5%.

What about a Bitcoin address that is held by the foundation, and just takes donations? Are the transactions at one address transparent?</description>

            <p>You are more than welcome. If I can eventually start using it inside my company replacing R2 (which has some concrete weird problems when used under heavy burden) I will be able to increase is substantially. That's why I was looking at bindings/ffi/libuv ... but now that holidays are gone so is my free time <img src="https://rebol.metaeducation.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=14" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> ... but I will chip away some to continue.</p>

As you can see the vm hosting rebolbot was costing about $20/month so that's why I canned it.</p>

<p>Well, I wouldn't hold my breath.  <img src="https://rebol.metaeducation.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=14" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
<p>But I think it's a lot easier to contribute to something if one knows exactly <em>what</em> one is paying for.  Especially because sometimes, people even have resources to bring to the table so you don't have to pay at all.</p>
<p>So let's see some itemizations of expenses...</p>

            <p>each cryptocurrency has it's own wallet address namespace.</p>
<p>cryptocurrencies don't have margin when you send it but has it when you convert to and from it. Also cryptocurrencies currently have high conversion rate risk. I am not against concept of crypto in general, just isn't reall practical currently.</p>

Yes, BTC is slow and expensive to use for payments.</p>

            <p>From what I've read, Bitcoin is both slow and expensive to exchange/convert into usable funds.<br>
While Patreon's 5% fee may seem high, I think it may be reasonable to try it. (I have some experienece with it -- I've been supporting a few artists on Patreon for over a year.) We should also look at alternatives.</p>
