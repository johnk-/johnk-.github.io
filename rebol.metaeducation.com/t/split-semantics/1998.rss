    <description>[On Red Gitter](https://gitter.im/red/red?at=63523097f00b697fec501c7a), it was discussed &quot;which of the following is &#39;correct&#39;&quot;:

    Red&gt; split &quot;&quot; &quot;,&quot;
    == [&quot;&quot;]

    R3&gt; split &quot;&quot; &quot;,&quot;
    == []

Rebolek thinks R3 is right.  Boris says:

&gt; I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a correct answer, just choices. I prefer the Red version because:
it strictly follows the rule: `number-of-segments = 1 + number-of-delimiters&quot;, no exceptions, so it&#39;s easier to reason about
&gt;
&gt; it should be able thus to preserve the type in case one wants to rejoin it later (that it doesn&#39;t is a bug, try split %&quot;&quot; &quot;,&quot;)

So there&#39;s a couple of ways to look at it.

But I have a philosophy about these things where I want edge cases to be &quot;noisy&quot;, because usually they require special handling.  I might even say:

    &gt;&gt; split &quot;&quot; &quot;,&quot;
    == ~null~  ; isotope</description>
