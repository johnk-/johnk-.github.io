    <title>What to Call Lone Tilde (~)</title>
    <link>https://rebol.metaeducation.com/t/what-to-call-lone-tilde/2216</link>
    <description>So this little guy doesn&#39;t have a name:

![1896_tilde|250x250, 50%](upload://lPs2dyWS6kN1weGeGoU7SyMbh5a.png)

Yes it&#39;s a &quot;tilde&quot;, but if there&#39;s a TILDE definition I think it should be talking about the character:

    &gt;&gt; char? tilde
    == ~okay~  ; anti

    &gt;&gt; quasiform? tilde
    == ~null~  ; anti

We&#39;re talking about something that evaluates to the antiform of space (the contents of an unset variable):

    &gt;&gt; eval [~]
    == ~  ; anti

## QUASI-SPACE?

It&#39;s an *accurate* name... 

    &gt;&gt; quasi _
    == ~

But if you&#39;re going to be testing for them easily in a block, you want something shorter.

Carl went on a bit of a bizarre track by deciding that #[none] was unweildy in blocks, and he liked zeros better... single characters... so [he started using zeros instead of nones, and made ZERO? accept everything](http://www.rebol.net/r3blogs/0112.html).

&gt; *I started using a lot more zeros in my data structures, especially those that had to be loaded from a file or database, because I knew that zero loaded more efficiently than NONE (no hash was required).*
&gt;
&gt; *For example, where I would once create REBOL-stored DB records like this:*
&gt;
&gt;     [&quot;name&quot; none none]
&gt;
&gt; *I would use:*
&gt;
&gt;     [&quot;name&quot; 0 0]
&gt;
&gt; *Because using 0 does not require a hash-and-compare operation (as does the word NONE) nor does it require binding (as does the value NONE)... nor is it the long-form literal #[none], that seems just a bit too cumbersome to my coding style.*

You&#39;re getting a lot of single-character choices in Ren-C, and which one you use kind of depends on what you want.

QUASI-SPACE is as ornery as it can be while being legal to appear in a block.  

## Does It Need A Name?

Something that makes it desirable for QUASI-SPACE to have a name is that because it&#39;s evaluative, you can&#39;t just compare to it directly without quoting it.

    if &#39;~ = second block [...]

SPACE doesn&#39;t have that problem.

    if _ = second block [...]

But still, Rebol tries to reduce the symboly-ness, and that looks nicer if there&#39;s a test you&#39;re going to be performing a lot:

    if space? second block [...]

So I think that QUASI-SPACE needs a nice short name, to help avoid people writing sequences like **`&#39;~ =`** often in their code.</description>

<p>[tripwire is] the smallest unit of trash</p>

</aside>
<p>The connection between WIRE and TRIPWIRE is pretty solid, but the connection between TRIPWIREs and... TRASH?</p>
<p>How many tripwires are tied to garbage cans?  <img src="https://rebol.metaeducation.com/images/emoji/twitter/thinking.png?v=14" title=":thinking:" class="emoji" alt=":thinking:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
<p>It's not the end of the world.  But if the analogies break down, this is where.</p>
<p>Trying to fix this little wrinkle (e.g. by changing TRASH! =&gt; EXPLOSIVE!, LANDMINE!, TNT!, C4!) probably does more harm than good.  But I'll leave it out there as a thinking point:</p>
<p>Is there something better to call TRASH! that doesn't make things worse, yet improves:</p>
<p><strong>Tripwire is the smallest unit of XXX!</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://rebol.metaeducation.com/images/emoji/twitter/red_question_mark.png?v=14" title=":red_question_mark:" class="emoji only-emoji" alt=":red_question_mark:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
<p>In truth, I don't think people are going to need to talk about <em>specific</em> trash very often.  The only place that does is the implementation (e.g. <code>Init_Tripwire(cell)</code>)  To try and keep some sanity I have to say things like <code>Any_Trash(...)</code> vs. <code>Is_Tripwire(...)</code> to help reinforce  the distinction between categories and instances, because it's easy to lose your bearings with things like <code>Is_Trash()</code> when you have the wrong idea.</p>
<p><strong>So it's far more important to get the name right for TRASH? than it is to name <code>~</code> antiforms <em>perfectly</em>.</strong>  Usually you'd just say "it's trash" or "it's antiform space" and move along.</p>

<p><strong>"<code>~</code> is a quasar"</strong> has come to settle with me... like I said... and I think it's better, and lets us keep QUASI? as the question to test for a quasiform.</p>

</aside>
<p>With the change of all antiform RUNE! to being TRASH! as an antiform category, it means that has mucked with the naming here a bit...</p>
<p>Antiform <code>~</code> is still <em>an instance</em> of TRASH!.  But saying "trash" <strong><code>~#[could mean anything in the category]#~</code></strong></p>
<p>Now that the term "tripwire" is free, I am thinking that <strong><em>antiform</em> <code>~</code></strong> might be best thought of as...</p>
<h2><a name="p-8336-a-tripwire-antiform-1" class="anchor" href="https://rebol.metaeducation.com#p-8336-a-tripwire-antiform-1"></a>"...a TRIPWIRE" (<code>~</code> antiform)</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It's the smallest unit of trash, and the hardest to see (as tripwires are hard to see)</p>
<ul>
<li>its visual lightness is part of its rationale for choosing it to represent things like unspecified slots in frames, to make them stand out</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Its quasiform state looks a little bit like a little squiggly piece of wire</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you access it via WORD! you get a panic, like setting off a bomb or alert with a tripwire</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>This would give us a fanciful and yet connected name for <code>~</code>... it could be just...</p>

<p>While again going down the weird route a bit, this idea at least tells a coherent story... and importantly, a story that crosses into <em>what it does</em> vs. just <em>what it looks like</em>.</p>

</aside>
<p>Those don't have verb forms.  You might think you're simplifying things by doing this, but you wind up with "dollarize" and "caretify" and such.</p>
<p><strong>But even more fundamentally: the characters don't go away.</strong>  You still have to talk about underscores and dollars and such as literals, or in strings...</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; second "a@b"
== #@  ; an AT, not a PIN

&gt;&gt; second [a @ b]
== @  ; a PIN, not an AT

&gt;&gt; @
** Error: @ is missing its argument to take literally

&gt;&gt; @ foo
== foo

&gt;&gt; #@
== #@
</code></pre>
<p>The evaluator behavior of "at" is to evaluate to an "at".  A "pin" does something different when it stands alone than when attached to something, but I still call it a pin.</p>

<p>What's particularly clever here now is that what would be <strong>(#" ")</strong> renders as <strong>_</strong> so it really <em>is</em> a SPACE, not an underscore or a "blank".</p>

<p>The problem here though, is that PINNED? and LIFTED? and TIED? are good words, but QUASID? and QUASIFIED? aren't so great.</p>

<p>Yes it's a "tilde", but if there's a TILDE definition I think it should be talking about the character.</p>

</aside>
<p>Why? It makes perfect sense to me to define TILDE as <code>~</code> and let the character be denoted as <code>"~"</code> (or whatever the syntax is, I forget).</p>

            <p>So this little guy doesn't have a name:</p>
<p></p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://rebol.metaeducation.com/uploads/default/original/1X/98fe977bff93e2b3dfd91a030a3c088d925cc1ec.png" data-download-href="https://rebol.metaeducation.com/uploads/default/98fe977bff93e2b3dfd91a030a3c088d925cc1ec" title="1896_tilde"><img src="https://rebol.metaeducation.com/uploads/default/original/1X/98fe977bff93e2b3dfd91a030a3c088d925cc1ec.png" alt="1896_tilde" data-base62-sha1="lPs2dyWS6kN1weGeGoU7SyMbh5a" width="125" height="125"></a></div><p></p>
<p>Yes it's a "tilde", but if there's a TILDE definition I think it should be talking about the character:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; char? tilde
== ~okay~  ; anti

&gt;&gt; quasiform? tilde
== ~null~  ; anti
</code></pre>
<p>We're talking about something that evaluates to the antiform of space (the contents of an unset variable):</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; eval [~]
== ~  ; anti
</code></pre>
<h2><a name="p-7381-quasi-space-1" class="anchor" href="https://rebol.metaeducation.com#p-7381-quasi-space-1"></a>QUASI-SPACE?</h2>
<p>It's an <em>accurate</em> name...</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; quasi _
== ~
</code></pre>
<p>But if you're going to be testing for them easily in a block, you want something shorter.</p>
<p>Carl went on a bit of a bizarre track by deciding that #[none] was unweildy in blocks, and he liked zeros better... single characters... so <a href="http://www.rebol.net/r3blogs/0112.html">he started using zeros instead of nones, and made ZERO? accept everything</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I started using a lot more zeros in my data structures, especially those that had to be loaded from a file or database, because I knew that zero loaded more efficiently than NONE (no hash was required).</em></p>
<p><em>For example, where I would once create REBOL-stored DB records like this:</em></p>
<pre><code>["name" none none]
</code></pre>
<p><em>I would use:</em></p>
<pre><code>["name" 0 0]
</code></pre>
<p><em>Because using 0 does not require a hash-and-compare operation (as does the word NONE) nor does it require binding (as does the value NONE)... nor is it the long-form literal #[none], that seems just a bit too cumbersome to my coding style.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You're getting a lot of single-character choices in Ren-C, and which one you use kind of depends on what you want.</p>
<p>QUASI-SPACE is as ornery as it can be while being legal to appear in a block.</p>
<h2><a name="p-7381-does-it-need-a-name-2" class="anchor" href="https://rebol.metaeducation.com#p-7381-does-it-need-a-name-2"></a>Does It Need A Name?</h2>
<p>Something that makes it desirable for QUASI-SPACE to have a name is that because it's evaluative, you can't just compare to it directly without quoting it.</p>
<pre><code>if '~ = second block [...]
</code></pre>
<p>SPACE doesn't have that problem.</p>
<pre><code>if _ = second block [...]
</code></pre>
<p>But still, Rebol tries to reduce the symboly-ness, and that looks nicer if there's a test you're going to be performing a lot:</p>
<pre><code>if space? second block [...]
</code></pre>
<p>So I think that QUASI-SPACE needs a nice short name, to help avoid people writing sequences like <strong><code>'~ =</code></strong> often in their code.</p>
