    <title>Say :NO to &quot;REDUCE/NO-SET&quot;</title>
    <link>https://rebol.metaeducation.com/t/say-no-to-reduce-no-set/2400</link>
    <description>I&#39;m converting @szeng&#39;s old c2r3 to Ren-C, and came across a use of a refinement I forgot existed, the &quot;NO-SET&quot; refinement of R3-Alpha:

    cbdata: make callback-data reduce/no-set [
        model: model
        path: gtk/tree_model_get_path model iter
    ]

What does it do, you ask?

    r3-alpha&gt;&gt; help reduce
    USAGE:
        REDUCE value /no-set /only words /into out

    DESCRIPTION:
        Evaluates expressions and returns multiple results.
        REDUCE is a native value.

    ARGUMENTS:
        value

    REFINEMENTS:
        /no-set -- Keep set-words as-is. Do not set them.
        /only -- Only evaluate words and paths, not functions
                words -- Optional words that are not evaluated (keywords) (block! none!)
        /into -- Output results into a block with no intermediate storage
                out (any-block!)

So basically, it just doesn&#39;t evaluate the SET-WORD!s in the block.

With generalized quoting, you don&#39;t need it:

    cbdata: make callback-data reduce [
        &#39;model: model
        &#39;path: gtk/tree_model_get_path model iter
    ]

Which approach seems more sane?

*(If it&#39;s not obvious why it&#39;s doing a REDUCE instead of letting the MAKE OBJECT! do the evaluations, it&#39;s because it wants to set a field called MODEL as well as use a variable called MODEL, and MAKE OBJECT! currently doesn&#39;t distinctly bind the SET-WORD! to not be in the object, though it probably should consider SET-WORD! to be in the object and plain WORD! to use the binding outside the object...)*

## Will Red Ever Realize How Wrong They Are?

They&#39;ve dug in on the stance that being able to quote anything to any level adds unnecessary complexity, calling them &quot;esoteric lexical forms&quot;:

But instead of solving the problem once and for all--in a uniform and systemic fashion--they live in a world where you have to invent things like /NO-SET.
