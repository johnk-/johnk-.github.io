    <title>Last Chance to Question --{...}-- for Strings</title>
    <link>https://rebol.metaeducation.com/t/last-chance-to-question-for-strings/2430</link>
    <description>It&#39;s getting quite close to the moment to cook up some new bootstrap executables and get the continuous integration back online.

The start of the derailment was the need to cease making `{...}` a string in the bootstrap sources, and support the new `-{...}-` or `--{...}--` etc. format.

I&#39;ve remarked on how this has been a surprisingly pleasant change.  It not only has a &quot;cut along dotted line&quot; character, but it also means you can worry less about escaping your braces inside of these strings.  That&#39;s especially important for things like JavaScript natives whose bodies are strings of JavaScript code... but it helps with headers too.

        It almost feels like &quot;cut along dotted line&quot;.
        I&#39;m surprisingly liking it.

        Defaulting to this makes it easy to stick in mentions
        of the }- construct used in code, without having to go
        touch up your delimiters when you introduce it.

```

I definitely do prefer the asymmetric delimiters to trying to do this with double quotes.

        This doesn&#39;t work for me.

        I almost dislike it enough to disallow it, so I don&#39;t
        have to see code that does this. 
    &quot;--
]
```

I think what I don&#39;t like about this is that it&#39;s like little darts pointing outward without really making a suggestion of grouping the inward things.  It lacks cohesion.

## BUT Nagging Question... Why --{...}-- and not --[...]-- ?

It crossed my mind to propose the idea of `-(...)-` etc. being interpolated strings.

    &gt;&gt; num: 1000

    &gt;&gt; print -(I&#39;m an interpolated (num + 20), string)-
    I&#39;m an interpolated 1020, string.

It seemed interesting to me that the delimiters being &quot;group-like&quot; gave a hint that some evaluation would be going on.

But that gives rise to another thought... **might --[...]-- being &quot;block-like&quot; give a hint of no evaluation?**

e.g. there&#39;s nothing FENCE!-like going on here.  The data is just inert.  What if we leveraged brackets as the inert string type?

        And it&#39;s all still just as easy to stick in mentions of

# --[o]--

In today&#39;s climate, of course we can see this as being more contentious with blocks... since they&#39;re much more common than FENCE!s.  It may seem like a whole lot of brackets:

    [--[this &quot;is&quot; a string]-- 1020 -[this too, how &quot;bad&quot; is this?]-]

However, do consider that as usage of FENCE! grows, there&#39;d be contention there too.  Also, syntax highlighting can help here for the not-completely-Amish cases.

## I Only Just Thought This, But It Seems Good To Me

Note that my impressions and opinions are formed from having lived with `--{...}--` for a while.  Being a day-to-day user changed my views from initial reluctance to happy acceptance.

And this looks even better to my thusly trained eyes.  :eyes: 

It does mean that things like JS-NATIVEs won&#39;t have things that look &quot;as much like&quot; their natural delimiters:

    quadrupler: js-native [num [integer!]] --[
        let num = reb.UnboxInteger(&quot;num * 2&quot;)
        return reb.Integer(num * 2)
    ]--

But really, were **`--{`** and **`}--`** pulling all that much weight here just because they had a brace?

    quadrupler: js-native [num [integer!]] --{
        let num = reb.UnboxInteger(&quot;num * 2&quot;)
        return reb.Integer(num * 2)
    }--

I&#39;m not seeing it.  The brackets feel cleaner, in part just because brackets are always cleaner.

And maybe this will help transition brackets over to braces for notations for construction-syntax types of things, to be more closely correlated with MAKE-ing things?

Anyone still paying attention have feedback here?</description>

            <p>It is likely that we'll wind up capitalizing on all the dash and asymmetric delimiter combinations, with some number of dashes on the outside...</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><code>--&lt;...&gt;--</code></strong> will be a way of doing TAG!s with things like <strong>&gt;</strong> or whatever inside them (kind of obvious)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><code>--(...)--</code></strong> will be some new textual type that evaluates the GROUP!s  nested inside of it when you run it in the evaluator.  Hopefully it will have a catchier name than COMPOSE-TEXT!</p>
<ul>
<li>Fancifully, what about COMPOSITE!  - It could actually use virtual binding to look up COMPOSE however you had it defined when it evaluates...so if you customize compose it would behave that way there.  (Maybe that's a terrible idea, would have to try it.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><code>--[...]--</code></strong>  I am now proposing to be plain inert TEXT!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><code>--{...}--</code></strong> is something I am pushing out of the way because I favor the look and correlation with inertness that brackets have for plain TEXT!.  But some interesting evaluator behavior for a text like thing might come out of this?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There's TRIM behavior. <img src="https://rebol.metaeducation.com/images/emoji/twitter/face_with_diagonal_mouth.png?v=14" title=":face_with_diagonal_mouth:" class="emoji" alt=":face_with_diagonal_mouth:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One thing we have to contend with is a notation that offers escaping vs. literalness.  Maybe instead of the proposals like <code>--^[...]^--</code> the <code>--{...}--</code> could be the form that offers escapes...</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>So what I'm proposing here for right now is taking all the current instances of <strong><code>--{...}--</code></strong> and friends, and making them into <strong><code>--[...]--</code></strong></p>
