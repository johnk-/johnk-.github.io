    <title>Oldes Rebol3.19.0 on Haiku, etc.</title>
    <link>https://rebol.metaeducation.com/t/oldes-rebol3-19-0-on-haiku-etc/2417</link>
    <description>As I have mentioned previously, Oldes is deserving of being the torch-bearer for R3-Alpha... in the sense that he&#39;s more or less kept everything the same.  He hasn&#39;t focused on working through issues in the language design... but more on bridging it so it can be used as a tool for many disparate things: ranging from MIDI to 2D graphics to interoperating with Spotify or GitHub, etc.

[https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/releases/tag/3.19.0](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3/releases/tag/3.19.0)

It seems he is in isolation delivering a lot more than Red, as far as the mission of *&quot;not fixing the language, just making an open source artifact to apply in its current state to more things.&quot;*

There&#39;s likely stuff to borrow from all of it, if it were time to do such a borrowing.

In any case, Rebolek is advocating for putting his version on HaikuDepot:

https://discuss.haiku-os.org/t/rebol-3-19-0-released-and-how-to-get-it-on-haikudepot/16643

I doubt this will draw much (any?) attention.  Despite adding more integrations, *I maintain that the R3-Alpha-era language delivers too little on its promises for why you would use the language in the first place.*  So few would see it worth overcoming the frustrations of the tool when its &quot;unique features&quot; are mostly a mirage.

But we&#39;ll see.  In any case, I coincidentally [built on Haiku again just yesterday](https://rebol.metaeducation.com/t/ren-c-builds-on-haiku/1710/4?u=hostilefork) ([I was the one who did the initial port](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jImeByEkV8Y)).  So if by some chance any rabid interest arises from that outreach, Ren-C will be around to offer some actual design and technology.</description>

  <p>Hello guys,  the title says it all - Oldes continues to do his fantastic job and released Rebol 3.19.0. If you know what Rebol is, you’re probably as excited as me and if you don’t know, it’s a language invented by Carl Sassenrath, author of...</p>
