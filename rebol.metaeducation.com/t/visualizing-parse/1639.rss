    <title>Visualizing PARSE</title>
    <link>https://rebol.metaeducation.com/t/visualizing-parse/1639</link>
    <description>&gt; *Note: This was originally posted in another thread about things people might want to do with parse events, but discussing the needs of this particular tool warrants its own thread.*

Because debugging parse rules can be painful, I created a Rebol 2 visual parse debugger of sorts ([parse-analysis-view.r](http://www.rebol.org/documentation.r?script=parse-analysis-view.r)). Parse events are needed to track the input position and log each rule&#39;s Test, Succeed, or Fail.  The events were mapped to screen coordinates to be able to step forwards/backwards through the parse steps and to be able to find the active rules under a mouse cursor position. Mapping strings was easy, mapping block input was a pain.

Running the visual debugger thing:

    visualise-parse t j/grammar [parse/all t j/grammar/json]

<p>Similar, though if I've understood on my brief glance, it looks like it's attempting to scan the rules to track events. I went with the dumber/simpler/possibly less fragile - let the user decide which rules to track and wrap those to create the event tracking.</p>

            <p>Boris has made something called "Parse SEE", which is a less-featured variation of parse-analysis-view.r.</p>

<p><a href="https://codeberg.org/hiiamboris/red-spaces/src/branch/master/programs/parsee.red">Here's the code for %parsee.red</a>.</p>
<p>I'm a bit confused because I thought Red offered some kind of events back from PARSE as callbacks and this would be based on that, but I see no indication that the call to PARSE uses the /TRACE refinement.  Without an in-depth analysis of uncommented code, I assume it's probably using methods that parallel parse-analysis-view.r.</p>
<p>There's one comment, about needing to "extract the names":</p>
<pre><code>;; I haven't found any other way to extract the names
;; I tried collecting first words of the 'fetch' event,|
;; but sometimes it may be at 'opt name' and who knows what other cases are possible

</aside>
<p>Long ago they mentioned a <a href="https://www.red-lang.org/2013/11/041-introducing-parse.html">PARSE /TRACE refinement</a> which takes a callback function.  Current Red reports the callback signature as:</p>
<pre><code> /trace       =&gt; 
    callback     [function! [
        event [word!]
        match? [logic!]
        rule [block!]
        input [series!]
        stack [block!]
        return: [logic!]
   ]] 
</code></pre>
<p>But because DiaGrammar is not open source we don't have immediate access to whether it uses that.  And because Red isn't LGPL'd we don't know what kind of hacked up version of Red they have; it's not a proof of what the language itself is capable of as pitched.</p>

            <p>Hmmm, didn't know it existed.  Well I had a bit of a look. Brief comments and thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>I was amused to see ABNF as the demo on the page, funny coincidence..</li>
<li>I noted the large number of rule sets - kudos.</li>
<li>Drawing the railroad diagrams is interesting but I don't get why you'd bother for a parse rule editor.  I've never seen anyone actually read them, they're hard to read.</li>
<li>I don't understand why you would have two languages on the same page saying the same thing (rebol parse rules and railroad diagrams).</li>
<li>Named rules are the focus, like my solution.</li>
<li>The generate thing doesn't really work that I can see. A fellow years ago on the rebol list, showed the usefulness of creating test data by generating from parse rules, his seemed to work.</li>
<li>They find a rule match in the test like I do with my buttons.</li>
<li>They have a "live" rule editing feature, which I assume means run parse in a loop.</li>
<li>I'm uninterested in styling the interface.</li>
<li>Looks like a work in progress.</li>
<li>I'm horrified that they'd advertise to charge $129 USD for a what looks like a proof of concept. I suppose it is free if you find the link.</li>
<li>While mine was not sexy, it is free, allows stepwise forward and backward, display rules at cursor, etc. just sayin...</li>

            <p>While we don't have a desktop GUI at the moment, <strong><a href="https://youtu.be/mjVtXfdTZIQ?t=70">the WebAssembly build has the full browser available</a>, and I'm on board for making sure UPARSE can give the hooks to help put something like this together.</strong>  It would make for a neat demo.</p>
<p>In the visual tooling category: I'll mention for anyone who doesn't know that Red's "DiaGrammar" now has a demo version you can try out.  The trial download link is <a href="https://www.redlake-tech.com/products/diagrammar-for-windows/">hiding at the bottom of the page</a>.</p>
<p>They don't seem to have any stepwise debugging feature, but they do have a way to do mapping between matched text and the rule that matched it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Not only can you see if an input matches your entire grammar, you can select specific rules and find where they match parts of your input."</em></p>

<p>I fiddled with it for 10 minutes and it didn't immediately work the way I thought...at least the generating sample input didn't.   If someone else can fiddle and report on it for me that would be helpful.  <img src="https://rebol.metaeducation.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=14" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
<p>(So <a class="mention" href="https://rebol.metaeducation.com/u/brett">@Brett</a>, if you can kind of tinker with it and explain the difference between what they're doing and what you did, I'm sure it would be illuminating.)</p>

<p>Because debugging parse rules can be painful, I created a Rebol 2 visual parse debugger of sorts (<a href="http://www.rebol.org/documentation.r?script=parse-analysis-view.r">parse-analysis-view.r</a>). Parse events are needed to track the input position and log each rule's Test, Succeed, or Fail.  The events were mapped to screen coordinates to be able to step forwards/backwards through the parse steps and to be able to find the active rules under a mouse cursor position. Mapping strings was easy, mapping block input was a pain.</p>
