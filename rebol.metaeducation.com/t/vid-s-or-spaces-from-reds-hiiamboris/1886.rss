    <title>VID/S or Spaces, from Red&#39;s hiiamboris</title>
    <link>https://rebol.metaeducation.com/t/vid-s-or-spaces-from-reds-hiiamboris/1886</link>
    <description>I haven&#39;t looked at it closely, but what I find interesting is that the demos are trying to show some non-trivial looking things:

  https://codeberg.org/hiiamboris/red-spaces

Here&#39;s the code for editing text on a spiral:

  https://codeberg.org/hiiamboris/red-spaces/src/branch/master/tests/spiral-test.red

I guess there&#39;s nothing particularly remarkable about it, in the sense that it&#39;s just a clickable canvas...drawing the whole thing every time.  Modern computers just happen to be pretty fast, so duplicating a couple of lorem ipsum texts 10 times isn&#39;t going to create all that much of a barrier to doing such a thing...even if Red is nothing special.

What I&#39;d consider &quot;remarkable&quot; would be if there was some design whereby you were inheriting selection behavior...so it was doing some kind of behavior-preserving coordinate transformation on a fully functional text editor widget.  It&#39;s not.

So that sort of dampens my interest in looking too much deeper.

The &quot;rotate a form&quot; demo is a more behavior-preserving example, but not a particularly profound one.  I&#39;m not completely sure what the pitch is.  CSS can do transforms, too.  3-D even.

            <p>There's now a 250-line VID/S markdown viewer example called "Redmark":</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberg.org/hiiamboris/red-spaces/src/branch/master/programs/redmark.red" class="inline-onebox">red-spaces/programs/redmark.red at master - hiiamboris/red-spaces - Codeberg.org</a></p>
<p>It depends on an external function called DECODE-MARKDOWN, which means its starting from a Red-friendly format of some kind.</p>
<p>If DECODE-MARKDOWN produces something parallel to an HTML DOM then this would basically be comparable to the CSS you'd need to render that on a page with proper resize behavior, I guess...</p>

            <p>Boris's Red Spaces <a href="https://codeberg.org/hiiamboris/red-spaces/src/branch/master/stylesheets/glossy.red">now supports "style sheets" of a kind</a>, so you can make themes:</p>
<p><img src="https://rebol.metaeducation.com/uploads/default/original/1X/b27ed2ca33a3e45d1ca5134db0a850af3f048728.gif" alt="styled" data-base62-sha1="pt2HS4RRFmLBtD3lcqu2BvcuWgM" width="690" height="429" class="animated"></p>
<p>I don't really have time (yet) with everything else going on to evaluate this stuff.  So I'd rather whatever audience Red can get hammers on it to filter out what's good.</p>
<p>(At some point I'll try my hand at a GUI dialect, but I'd like to be reacting to the polished and critiqued version of whatever evolves out of their world.)</p>

            <p>Boris saw this post and responded by updating his samples with selections on a spiral, so that's good to see that works, and that his plans are somewhat more ambitious than traditional VID:</p>
